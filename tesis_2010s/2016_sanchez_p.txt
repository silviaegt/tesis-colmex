Abstract In the following dissertation paper, I developed three economic environments in the presence of conflict, in order to analyze different contexts where conflict may change the expected outcome. The chapters are organized as follows: Chapter 1 is an introduction in which an overview of the dissertation paper is provided. In chapter 2 and chapter 3, two economic models, both with conflict contexts, are developed, in order to study the drug fight in transit countries. Finally, in chapter 4, an economic model of private property in an appropriation environment is analyzed. As it has been mentioned, the first model, in chapter 2, describes drug fight in transit countries, allowing an endogenous coalition formation. In this section, an external observer gives incentives to the State to fight against drug trafficking. It is shown, as a result, that an increase on State incentives reduces drug trafficking and violence in transit countries, assuming that only the grand coalition and the singleton structure can be formed. However, a simultaneous increase on State incentives and drug market parameters may increase drug trafficking and violence. The second model, in chapter 3, shares context with the first one, but it displays a more general setting, where traffickers may form any kind of coalition structure may be formed by traffickers. An important result in this chapter is that when traffickers do not change their behavior, if State incentives increase, then drug trafficking and violence decrease. In contrast, when traffickers change their behavior, if State incentives increase then drug trafficking and violence. The contribution of both chapters is the generalized model of coalition formation with conflict presence, which is not normally used. Therefore, the model is, by itself, an interesting result in the coalition formation and conflict literature. In chapter 4, a model in which agents can create private property rights on a resource by making appropriative activities is explained. Here, it is shown that the value of any resource has a nonmonotonic effect on the emergence of private property. When the resource is sufficiently valuable, agents have an incentive to leave a sharing agreement and private property can emerge. If the value of the resource increases, beyond a given threshold, deviations from the sharing agreement lead to a very costly confrontation. In order to avoid this, agents stay in the agreement and private property is no longer sustainable. Additionally, it is demonstrated that population size has an important effect on the size of the parameter set, in which private property is sustainable.

Resumen. En esta tesis se desarrollan tres ambientes económicos, con presencia de conflicto entre agentes, para analizar diferentes contextos donde el conflicto puede cambiar el resultado esperado. Los capítulos de la tesis están organizado de la siguiente forma: Capítulo 1 es una introducción de la tesis. En el capítulo 2 y capítulo 3 se muestran dos modelos económicos en un contexto de conflicto, para estudiar la lucha contra las drogas en los países de tránsito. Finalmente, en el capítulo 4 se analiza un modelo económico de apropiación de propiedad privada. Como se mencionó antes, el primer modelo del capítulo 2 describe la lucha contra las drogas en países de tránsito, en el cual se permite la formación endógena de coaliciones. En el modelo, un observador externo otorga incentivos al Estado para que combata el tráfico. En los resultados se muestra que un aumento en los incentivos del Estado reduce el tráfico y la violencia, suponiendo que sólo se puede formar la gran coalición o la coalición individual. Sin embargo, un incremento simultáneo en los incentivos y los parámetros del mercado de droga elevan el tráfico y la violencia. En el capítulo 3 se expone un segundo modelo que comparte el contexto del primero, pero considera un escenario donde los traficantes pueden formar cualquier estructura de coalición. Uno de los resultados es que, si los traficantes no cambian su comportamiento, un aumento en los incentivos del Estado, reduce el tráfico y la violencia. En contraste, si los traficantes cambian su comportamiento, el incremento en los incentivos eleva el tráfico y la violencia. La contribución de ambos capítulos es un modelo generalizado de formación de coaliciones en presencia de conflicto, lo cual no es utilizado comúnmente. Por esta razón, el modelo, por sí mismo, es un resultado dentro de la literatura de formación de coaliciones y la de conflicto. En el capítulo 4, se presenta un modelo en el que los agentes pueden crear derechos de propiedad mediante actividades de apropiación. Aquí, se muestra que el valor del recurso tiene un efecto no monótono en la aparición de la propiedad privada; cuando el recurso es valioso, los agentes dejan el acuerdo de reparto comunal y surge la propiedad privada. Si el valor del recurso aumenta, por encima de un valor crítico, las desviaciones del acuerdo de reparto pueden provocar una confrontación muy costosa; para evitar esto, los agentes permanecen en el acuerdo y la propiedad privada no es sostenible. Adicionalmente, se demuestra que el tamaño de la población, tiene un efecto en el tamaño del conjunto de parámetros, en los cuales la propiedad privada es sostenible.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
In this dissertation paper I develop three microeconomic models where agents are in a conﬂict framework. In these models I allow that agents can form endogenous coalitions. In other words, agents can either associate or be alone. As more coalitions are formed the intensity of the conﬂict is bigger, therefore it is more costly to form small coalitions rather than big coalitions. Therefore agents rationally decide whether to ﬁght with each other, in order to avoid splitting the total payoff with more people, or make agreements to obtain the highest payoff possible.
In many contexts, conﬂicts affects economic variables, but also economics variables can provoke conﬂicts, so we can say that there is a relationship between conﬂicts and economics. For example, when agents or countries ﬁghts for a valuable economic resource, also there is a direct relationship between countries defense expenditure and conﬂict.
A ﬁrst example, in Mexico’s history is the land reform approved in 1992. Farmers could obtain the property rights, but there is some cases where they agree to keep the common land. This conﬂict may not have harmful consequences, however most of the farmers had to spend resources and time in lawyers and courts to obtain that rights. A second example is the recent drug ﬁght that is affecting several economic decisions and the intensity of the conﬂict has been very high in the last years.
In the three games that I present in this (dissertation) paper, I model the conﬂict with Contest Success Function. This functions are used in most of the conﬂict context. The next two chapters are dedicated to develop theoretical model of drug ﬁght in Mexico.
In chapter 2, I develop a model for drug ﬁghting with an endogenous coalition formation framework. In the model, there is an external observer who gives incentives to the State to ﬁght drug trafﬁc. Trafﬁckers only can behave either competitively or cooperatively. In this model I consider the drug policy variables change and drugs market variables change. I show that only in the case in which trafﬁckers do not change their behavior, upon a change on State incentives then drug trafﬁc and violence decrease in the transit country. However, a simultaneous increase on State incentives and drug market parameters generally induce a change in trafﬁckers’ behavior. Therefore, drug trafﬁc and violence may increase.
In chapter 3, I also develop a model for drug ﬁghting in transit countries which allows endogenous
8

coalition formation. A difference with chapter one, in this model I use a sequential coalition formation game which allows that trafﬁckers can form any kind of coalition structure. Another difference in this chapter is that I only consider the drug policy variables change. I show that when trafﬁckers do not change their behavior, then an increase on State incentives reduces drug trafﬁc and violence. However, when trafﬁckers change their behavior, an increase on State incentives generally increase drug trafﬁc and violence. Finally in chapter 4, agents can create private property rights on a resource by making appropriative activities. We show that the value of the resource has a non monotonic effect on the emergence of private property. When the resource is sufﬁciently valuable, agents have an incentive to leave a sharing agreement and private property can appear. If the value of the resource increases beyond a given threshold, deviations from the sharing agreement lead to a very costly confrontation so in order to avoid that, agents stick to the agreement. In that case, private property is not sustainable. Another important result is that population size has an important effect on the size of the parameter set in which private property is sustainable.

2.1 Introduction

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT

Mexico’s former President Felipe Calderon president initiated what he called a ”Drug War” in 2006. That policy was aimed at reducing drug trafﬁcking in Mexico. As a result, the National Security Expenditure on Defense increased from 2009 to 2011 in Mexico, but with that increase a number of closely related phenomena were observed. Firstly, the strategic ﬁnancial and military aid from the United States (US) considerably increased in 2008 under the Merida Initiative. It increased from 50 million dollars in 2007 to 378 million dollars in 2008. Secondly, cocaine price went up nearly to 50 % from 2006 to 2008. Thirdly, the drug cartels in Mexico were fragmented between 2008 and 2011, from 8 to 12, respectively. In those years of drug war, a growth in the number of killings was patent. From 2007 to 2008, the number of homicides went up from nine thousand to fourteen thousand. Furthermore, the number of homicides continued increasing until 2011, when 26 thousand of homicides were accounted, according to the Statistics National Institute in Me´xico (INEGI).
It’s been stated that the state expenditure under a regime of prohibition may be related to levels of violence, for instance J. Miron (1999) ﬁnds that US spending associated with a severe compliance of the law against alcohol and drugs, it is positively related to homicide rates. Regarding the Mexican context, some authors have found that the policy of the ”War on Drugs” is clearly related to violence, Rios (2010) and Dell (2011). Other factors affecting the level of violence in Mexico are the anti-drug policies which are made in the drug-producing countries, such as Colombia, Mejia at al. (2011). According to these articles, the highest point related to violence is a result of anti-drug policies.
The underlying thesis of the quoted authors is based on the assumption that drug dealers behave competitively. Accordingly, trafﬁckers need to monopolize crime in the territories where they operate. However, there is evidence that the drug cartels are associated with other criminal organizations, (Rios (2012)). In addition, Guerrero (2011) mentioned that major Drug Cartels in Mexico were fragmented and began intense conﬂicts with their former allies. For example, the Sinaloa cartel was fragmented into six cartels between 2008 and 2010, while the Gulf Cartel split in two in 2010. After the division of the Sinaloa Cartel, there was a dramatic increase in violence, Osorno

2.1. INTRODUCTION
(2009). In support of this view, Grossman and Mejia (2008) developed a model to study drug policies in producing countries. In their model, the state wants to reduce signiﬁcantly the supply of drugs to consumer countries. Drug producers and the state are facing various conﬂicts to maximize their proﬁts. The Grossman - Mejia model establishes a framework for evaluating policies against drugs and the effects of violence without overlooking the fact that drug trafﬁckers also behave competitively. In this chapter, I develop a cooperative model similar to Grossman–Mejia’s model to study the conﬂict between the state and trafﬁckers. This model is a three-stage sequential game. In the ﬁrst stage, the outsider select the proportion of resources and the level of punishment to give incentives to the State to ﬁght against drug trafﬁckers. In the second stage, trafﬁckers decide whether to behave cooperatively and form a cartel or to behave competitively and become individual trafﬁckers. In the third stage, individual trafﬁckers or the cartel confront openly against the state in a conﬂict over a drug trafﬁcking network. We must also consider that there is an outside observer, which provides incentives to the state in order to combat trafﬁcking. In this chapter, I establish that State incentives, drug price, and size of the network, have an endogenous effect in the behavior of trafﬁckers. Besides the features mentioned, one have to ponder that drug prohibition policies reduce trafﬁc and violence when drug prices and the trafﬁcking network remain constant. However, when drug prices and the trafﬁcking network are altered, the results of the drug prohibition policy may have uncertain effects. The chapter is organized as follows: In the following section, the economic environment for the trafﬁckers game is set up. In Sections 3 and 4, I obtain, by the model proposed, respectively the optimal decision for the third stage, and the choice of a coalition structure. Finally, conclusions are set in Section 5.

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT
2.2 Economic Environment
I model the trafﬁckers’ problem as a sequential three stages cooperative game. This model consider a conﬂict between trafﬁckers and the State, in which trafﬁckers obtain a beneﬁt from trafﬁcking drugs and the State wants to reduce the drugs that are trafﬁcked.
In this game, there is an external observer, O, which gives incentives to the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking. I model the external observer as a nature player and because of that he does not receive payoffs. There is a set N = {1, 2, . . . , n} of identical trafﬁckers, they are identical in all relevant aspects, which want to maximize their proﬁts trafﬁcking drugs to a consumer countries. There is also a State, S, which wants to reduce trafﬁcking in his country.
Grossman and Mej´ıa (2008) deﬁne an external observer. In this game, I model the external observer as a nature player. The nature player chooses the fraction of resources 1 − Ω, from an uniform distribution U [0, 1], which the State receives as a help in its drug ﬁght. It also selects the level of punishment h, from a U [0, ∞], that the State receives if it does not ﬁght trafﬁckers.
Each trafﬁcker chooses a number aˆi ∈ [1, n] that represents the number of players of the coalition that he wishes to be. He also chooses the number of resources xi ∈ [0, ∞), valued in dollars, that he wants to spend in the conﬂict with the State. The State only chooses its level of investment Z ∈ (0, ∞), valued in dollars, in the conﬂict with drug trafﬁckers.
In the ﬁrst stage, the nature selects the fraction of resources that it will give to the state and the punishment level, which is known by all players. In the second stage, the set N of trafﬁckers form coalitions between them, these coalitions will be called cartels. I model the coalition formation with the Γ game from Hart and Kurz, (1983), which allows to the players to behave cooperatively. The game consists in different players who make lists of which other players they want to make a coalition with. If all players have the same list, then a coalition is formed. If they do not have the same list, then they become trafﬁckers (singleton coalition)1. In this game, trafﬁckers simultaneously choose a number aˆi to form a coalition with that many players, after this a coalition
1For example consider that the set of players is N = {1, 2, 3}, player1 and player 2 list is Li = {1, 2}, and player 3 list is L3 = {1, 2, 3}. In this case, a coalition is not formed, and the coalition structure is Π = {1, 2, 3}. However, if player 3 list is L3 = {3}, then players 1 and 2 form a coalition and player 3 becomes a singleton. The coalition structure, in this case, is Π = {12, 3}.
14

2.2. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
structure π = {a1, a2, . . . , am} is formed, this will be explained, with more detail, below. The number of cartels that trafﬁckers form is m which is less or equal than n. This game is very restrictive because it gives veto power to any agent on the coalitions. This assumption will be relaxed in the next chapter.
In the third stage, the m cartels and the State engage in a conﬂict for the divisible network W > 0. In order to obtain a fraction of the network, each trafﬁcker invests xi resources. The resources that coalition j invest in the conﬂict is Xj = i∈aj xi. The State invests Z resources. I model the conﬂict with a standard Contest Success Function (CSF)2,

(2.1)

where Φj ≡ Φ(aj) is a function that represents the effectiveness of cartel j in the conﬂict, this function depends on the group size aj. Once, cartel or trafﬁckers acquire a fraction of the network, enables them to sell drugs in the consumer country and obtain C potential proﬁts from trafﬁc. Simultaneously, the State wants to destroy the network, in order to reduce the trafﬁc and the supply of drugs.

that every player in the coalition makes an effort strictly positive. If a trafﬁcker that belongs to

in this model. Trafﬁckers payoffs are the share of the coalition potential proﬁts from the drug

market, less the conﬂict cost. Payoffs for each drug trafﬁcker i who belongs to cartel aj is

if {y} is zero.

However, not invest strategy is weakly dominated, then I only

consider the non-zero part. See Skaperdas (1996) for an axiomatization.

3This assumption may seem reliable in this context because if a trafﬁcker does not pay the conﬂict cost from the coalition, then

other coalition members try to kill him or people related to him (Family or collaborators), this is the punishment. Some stories

related with drugs trafﬁckers life mention that in 1992, Ismael Zambada didn’t pay tariffs to Tijuana cartel, and then Arellano

Felix brothers, Benjamin and Ramon, attempted to his life; Blancoornelas (2002). In 2004, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes didn’t pay his

security share with the Federacion cartel, and then a year later Sinaloa cartel members kill his brother; Hernandez, (2010).

State Payoffs

The state does not want to be punished by the nature; therefore he wants to reduce drug trafﬁc. Without the state intervention, drugs that could be trafﬁcked are λW , where λ represents the potential drug that may be trafﬁcked in the network W . When the State intervenes trafﬁcking is

D = λ pjW,
j=1

(2.3)

where D ≤ λW .

then

hD S = (1 − Ω)Z − − Z.
λW Using equation 2.3 in the equation above, the State payoff is

m
S = −h pj − ΩZ.
j

(2.4)

Then a maximization on State payoff implies a minimization in State cost of drug ﬁght.

2.2. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1 First Stage
I assume that the outside observer is a nature player, which selects the level of punishment h and the fraction of resources 1 − Ω, as described above. Grossman and Mejia (2008) assume the existence of an outside observer which wants to minimize the drugs that are trafﬁcked to the consumer country. The observer uses a stick and carrots strategy, which gives incentives to the State to ﬁght against trafﬁckers. If the state does not combat, then the observer labels it as a ”Narco-State”, which represents a cost to the state h; this is the stick. This observer provides aid4 valued in dollars, to help the ﬁght against drugs in the transit country; this is the carrot.
2.2.2 Second stage
In the second stage, the n drug trafﬁckers form coalitions with the Γ game, which is explained above. A coalition structure is a partition from the set N . The identical trafﬁckers assumption implies that the main difference between coalitions is the number of players that belong to the same coalition. Then a coalition structure for this game can be written as π = {a1, a2, . . . , am}, where aj is the group size5. Once stated these settings, I modify the Γ game, in the following way. The players propose a number aˆi of members who they want to be associated with. If each player can be assigned with a number of members that he’s chosen, then a coalition structure π = {aˆ1, aˆ2, . . . , aˆm} is formed. If at least one player cannot be assigned, then a trafﬁckers (singleton) structure π = {1, 1, . . . , 1} is formed.
4Money; training to the State police and army forces; intelligence reports; etc. 5In this case, two different coalition structure, Π and Π , may have the same coalition structure π. For example, in the three players case, two different coalition structures are Π = {12, 3} and Π = {13, 2}, however they have the same coalition structure π = {2, 1}.
17

2.2.3 Third Stage

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT

In the third stage, drug cartels and the State ﬁght for a fraction of the drug trafﬁcking network W , given the coalition structure π. The network represents territories, corrupt agents, ports where drugs arrive to the transit countries, laboratories, routes to the consumer country, etc. Trafﬁc of drugs is proportional to the fraction network that each cartel control.
They compete accordingly with the CSF, equation 2.1. Cartel j controls a network of size pjW this fraction allows it to trafﬁc drugs. The State wants to destroy the network, in order to reduce the probability to be punished.
I assume that there is a superadditivity technology6 in trafﬁckers’ coalitions. In other words, I assume Φ(aj) in equation 2.1 is a continuous non-decreasing function of the number of cartel members, aj. I also assume, as well as Grossman and Mej´ıa, (2008); that trafﬁckers are more effective in the conﬂict than the State because they can use guerrilla techniques. This assumption implies that Φ(1) > 1. Finally, I assume that conﬂict does not destroy the network7. However, an increment in conﬂict resources is positively related with violence rates, i.e. the number of homicides.
In this game, given the punishment level h and the resources from the external observer 1 − Ω, the trafﬁckers strategy is a vector of members {aˆi} of the possible coalition, and the resources xi that he is willing to invest given the coalition structure π. The State strategy is the resources that he is willing to spend Z given π.
Before to solve this problem, I deﬁne intensity of the conﬂict as the effective resources spent in the conﬂict,

m
I ≡ Z + ΦjXj.
j=1

(2.5)

6See Skaperdas (1998), and Garﬁnkel and Skaperdas (2006) for a review on superadditivity coalitions games. 7It is possible to relax this assumption assuming that a more intensive conﬂict destroys a higher fraction of the network than less intensive conﬂicts. However, the assumption seems to ﬁt as cartels replace their territories in less than three years in average; Rios, (2012).
18

2.3. OPTIMAL TRAFFICKERS AND STATE EXPENDITURE
This deﬁnition simplify the notation below, it only says that as the resources, considering the effectiveness function, increase, then the conﬂict between the State and cartels is more intense.
Following Miron (1999), the government expenditure in law enforcement against alcohol and drugs is directly related to the rates in homicides. Due to this fact, it is possible to deﬁne violence as the total amount of resources that the State and coalitions spend8,

m
V = Z + Xj.
j

(2.6)

As a consequence, any increment in the total amount of resources in the conﬂict increases the amount of violence. One must also remember that the number of trafﬁckers’ coalitions has an important effect on violence levels. Intuitively, one may think that when players cooperate they spend less money and in this case violence levels are lower.

2.3 Optimal Trafﬁckers and State Expenditure
From the previous section, the observer (nature player) selects an {h, 1 − Ω}, from a uniform distribution. Trafﬁckers choose the number of players which they want to be associated with, and the number of resources that he invests given the coalition π, i.e. {aˆi, xi∈aj }. Finally, the State decides the number of resources that he invests in the conﬂict, Z.
An equilibrium in pure strategies, in this game, consists in a level of punishment, and fraction of resources, {h, 1 − Ω}. A vector of aˆi∗ which form a coalition π and a vector of resources spend in the conﬂict xi∈aj, Z. Then only symmetrical structures are formed. In other terms, at equilibrium the coalition structure is π = {a, a, . . . , a}, where a is a divisor of n.
To see this consider the three player example, N = {1, 2, 3}. Let the coalition structures and individual payoffs to be: πgc = {3} and Rgc for the grand cartel; πs = {1, 1, 1} and Rs for the singleton structure; and π = {1, 2}, R1 the payoff for the singleton, and R2 the payoff for the
8This deﬁnition may seem restrictive and arbitrary, therefore I use two alternative deﬁnition of violence in appendix 2.
19

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT
two-member coalition.
Suppose that R1 > R2 > Rgc > Rs. In this case all players want to be the singleton in coalition structure π = {1, 2}, then all of them has incentives to propose aˆi = 1 but it yields to the singleton structure where all are worse. Because they know that and there is no communication between them, they proposes aˆi = 3 which is the equilibrium. Suppose it is not and without loss of generality player 1 deviates and chooses aˆ1 = 1 as the other two players are choosing aˆi = 3, with i = 1, 2, then the coalition structure can not be formed and the protocol forms the singleton coalition structure with Rs < Rgc therefore no one deviates. The argument is the same for R1 > Rgc > R2 > Rs, also to R2 > R1 > Rgc > Rs and to R2 > Rgc > R1 > Rs. The argument is similar of the previous one, but in these cases players choose the singleton structure for R1 > R2 > Rs > Rgc, also to R1 > Rs > R2 > Rgc, this one to R2 > R1 > Rs > Rgc, and to R2 > Rs > R1 > Rgc. If the grand cartel or the singleton strategies are dominant then the result is trivial. Similar argument applies when the number of players is bigger and it is considered asymmetrical coalition structures.
In this chapter, it’s only consider the grand cartel (Below I call this structure as the cartel) πgc = {n} and the trafﬁckers structure πs = {1, 1, . . . , 1}. Therefore, if trafﬁckers behave cooperatively, they form a cartel. If they behave competitively, a trafﬁckers structure is formed.
I use backward induction to solve the problem. In the third stage trafﬁckers maximize their individual payoffs, 2.2, given the coalition structure π. I divide the solution between the trafﬁckers coalition structure πs and the cartel coalition structure πgc. At the end of this section, I summarize responses changes as parameters changes when coalition structure remains constant.
2.3.1 Trafﬁckers Structure Solution
Here, I describe the solution for the trafﬁckers coalition structure πs. Trafﬁckers identical assumption implies that they will spend the same resources and obtain the same network fraction in the trafﬁckers structure. Then a expenditure vector {xi, Z} = {xs, Zs} and a fraction network vector {pi} = {ps} is a solution for this problem in the third stage.

the FOC are sufﬁcient if the State expenditure is lower than the potential proﬁts considering the effectiveness of the grand cartel. Z < CW Φgc. Notice that for the no free riding assumption if the cartel invest in the conﬂict then every member spend a positive amount on it. The State minimize costs, given the coalition structure πgc, the FOC for the State is

2.3.3 Incentives Changes
The Solution for both coalition structures, trafﬁckers and cartel respectively, are in parameters. In this section, parameters change are analyzed, when trafﬁckers do not change their behavior. In other words, I assume that the second stage of the game does not exist, in this section, and I analyze the effects on the results. Conditions under which the coalition structure changes are provided in proposition 2.4.1, in the next section.
The analysis of this section is important because most of the studies which analyze the impact on drugs policy in drug trafﬁc (e.g. Grossman and Mejia (2008); Rios (2013); Dell (2015)), assume that the coalition structure does not change. Most of them obtain that if there is an increase in international resources or punishment then drugs trafﬁc decreases (which is the result on proposition 2.3.2), or if the potential proﬁts from drugs sells decrease then it reduces trafﬁc activities (the result on proposition 2.3.3). I obtain a similar results to them when trafﬁckers are not allowed to change the coalition structure. But in the next section, I show that these results are not so obvious when they are allow to change between coalitions.
Proposition 2.3.2. If coalition structure does not change, whenever State punishment (international resources) increases (increase), then State expenditure increases; trafﬁckers in-
25

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT
dividual proﬁts and drugs trafﬁc decrease. As a collateral effect violence increases.
Proof : See Appendix 1 Proposition 2.3.2 summarizes the results when the coalition structure remains constant, and punishment or international resources increase9. In other words, when the State incentives increase. The results are expected by the policy. As the observer gives more incentives, the State spends more resources in the conﬂict, then trafﬁckers network fraction decreases, which reduces drugs trafﬁc and trafﬁckers’ proﬁts. Finally, an undesirable effect is that violence rates increase.
Proposition 2.3.3. If coalition structure does not change, whenever network size (potential proﬁts) increases (increase), then trafﬁckers individual proﬁts and drug trafﬁc increase. However, State expenditure and violence may decrease.
Proof: See Appendix 1 Remark A necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for a decreasing violence in the trafﬁckers structure is Φs > 2; and in the cartel structure is Φgc > (n − 1)Φs + 2. Proposition 2.3.3 summarizes the results when the coalition structure remains constant and potential proﬁts or the network size increase. i.e. trafﬁckers incentives increase. These results are as expected, also. With more incentives coalitions spend more resources in the conﬂict, then trafﬁckers network fraction increases, which increases drugs trafﬁc and trafﬁckers proﬁts. However, in this case, the State expenditure may decrease, and then violence change is uncertain.
2.4 Coalition Structure Choice
In the second stage, trafﬁckers compare between trafﬁckers and cartel structures and choose the one with higher proﬁts.
9An increment on international resources implies that Ω decreases

Simplifying this expression, it is obtained the expression in the proposition.

Notice that, if the term in brackets, in equation 2.29, on the right hand side is negative, then cooperation is a dominant strategy in the second stage.

The left hand side on the condition is increasing with respect to State incentives10.The right hand side is decreasing with State incentives and increasing with trafﬁckers incentives.

Remark: If the State incentives increase, then trafﬁckers have more incentives to behave cooperatively, i.e. collusion incentives increase. If trafﬁckers incentives increase, then trafﬁckers have more incentives to behave competitively.

This result is very intuitive. When State incentives increase; trafﬁckers prefer, behave cooperatively to ﬁght a stronger enemy. If trafﬁckers incentives increase, then it is more difﬁcult to keep a cooperative agreement because deviations from it are more proﬁtable.

Figure 2.1 shows the change on the dependent variables as State incentives change, as well as the coalition structure choice. In this ﬁgures crosses lines (x) represent Cartel solution, and pluses lines (+) represent trafﬁckers solution. The continuous lines are the equilibrium outcome at different levels of the State incentives of the game. Figure 2.1.a shows individual trafﬁckers’ proﬁts. Figure 2.1.b illustrate the increasing State expenditure. Figure 2.1.c and 2.1.d shows drugs that are

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT trafﬁcked and violence levels respectively. Figure 2.1 shows the intuition in proposition 2.4.1. State expenditure increases as the State incentives do. Proﬁts in the trafﬁckers structure decrease faster than cartel structure proﬁts, then trafﬁckers prefer to collude than ﬁght each other. Drugs trafﬁc and violence equilibrium paths are discontinuous as coalition structure changes. Therefore, as State incentives increase there can be a big reduction on trafﬁcking and violence.

Proposition 2.4.2. Suppose that Φs = Φgc = Φ < n + 1. In this case, drug trafﬁc and violence are higher in the trafﬁckers structure than in the cartel structure. Proof If Φgc = Φs = Φ, then pgc = ps, which proofs the drugs trafﬁc part of the proposition because pgc < i ps. In the second part of the proposition I want to show that Vs − Vgc > 0, If Φgc = Φs = Φ then Is = nIgc, then from 2.19 and 2.28 it is sufﬁcient to show that

Notice that this equation is increasing with respect to

By equation 2.29 I know that

h Ω

n

≥

(n − 1)CW Φ, then the expression 2.30 is bigger than

(n + 1)CW − CW Φ

(2.31)

Which is bigger than zero, because Φ < n + 1. Hence, violence in the trafﬁckers structure is higher than violence in the cartel.
These results are expected. When trafﬁckers behave competitively, trafﬁcking activities and violence rates are bigger than when they behave cooperatively. Thus, an increment in State incentives, when everything else remains constant, increases cooperative incentives between trafﬁckers, which reduces drugs trafﬁc and violence rates. However, when state incentives and trafﬁckers incentives increase simultaneously, may lead to undesired results, as trafﬁckers may change from the cartel to the singleton (here and below I use singleton coalition structure as same as trafﬁckers coalition structure). The following proposition shows how the coalition structure change affect the outcomes.

Proposition 2.4.3. Suppose that Φs = Φgc = Φ < n + 1 and hf ≥ h0; Ωf ≥ Ω0; Cf ≥ C0; and Wf ≥ W0, where the subindex f is the ﬁnal state and the subindex 0 is the initial state.

If State and trafﬁckers incentives increase simultaneously, i.e

hf Ωf

h0 Ω0

and Cf Wf

such that there is a coalition structure change from cartel to singleton structure, then drugs

trafﬁc and violence rates increase.

These conditions satisfy the

Claim: Vsf > Vgc0.
If Φgc = Φs then violence in the cartel structure increases with trafﬁckers incentives, by proposition 2.3.3. From propositions 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, violence in the cartel structure increases, i.e. ∆Vgc = Vgcf − Vgc0 > 0. Finally, total violence after the fragmentation of the cartel increases, i.e. ∆V = Vsf − Vgc0 > Vgcf − Vgc0 > 0, by proposition 2.4.2.
Proposition 2.4.3 shows that if trafﬁckers and state incentives change simultaneously, may change trafﬁckers behavior. Therefore, drugs12 and violence rates are higher, as trafﬁckers behave competitively instead of cooperatively. Next ﬁgure 2.2 shows this result.

Figure 2.2 shows drugs and violence change as potential proﬁts and state incentives increase. In this case, potential proﬁts increase 50%. Crosses (x) and pluses (+) lines represent cartel and singleton solutions, respectively, before the increment on potential proﬁts, at Q0. Asterisks (*) and circles (o) lines represent cartel and singleton solutions, respectively, after potential proﬁts increase. D0 and V0 are the drug trafﬁc and violence, respectively, before the change. D1 and V1 represent the ﬁrst hypothetical change on drugs and violence, respectively, when the coalition structure does not change. D2 and V2 represent the second hypothetical change on drug and violence when the coalition structure changes.

Figure 2.2 shows two situations. In the ﬁrst situation, coalition structure does not change. In this
case, trafﬁcking activities may decrease if the State incentives change is big enough. However,
violence increases, because the State and the cartel expenditure increase with both incentives. In
the second situation, the coalition structure changes. In this case, drugs and violence increase. This
11If the network size decreases, then the result is uncertain, then the nondecreasing assumption is necessary in this case 12Drugs result is weaker than violence result with respect to Φgc = Φs assumption. If the technology is increasing, Φgc > Φs, the result may reverse.

2.5. CONCLUSION
increment on drug trafﬁc activities is unexpected by prohibition policies.
In this section, I show that an increase in State incentives, with everything else constant, increases cooperation incentives between trafﬁckers. Therefore, violence rates and trafﬁc activities decrease. However, if state incentives and trafﬁckers incentives increase simultaneously, such that trafﬁckers fragment, then trafﬁc activities and violence rates increase.
2.5 Conclusion
In this chapter, I develop a sequential cooperative game with three stages where players endogenously choose, in order to study drug trafﬁcking in transit countries. The model takes into consideration that there is a conﬂict between the State and trafﬁckers for a drug trafﬁc network. However, in the second stage trafﬁckers may decide whether, to behave cooperatively and form a cartel or to behave competitively and become single trafﬁckers.
It is shown, that players rationally cooperate when they expect that the State will invest a lot of resources in the conﬂict. However, if the prize (potential proﬁts from the network) is high enough they behave competitively. Therefore trafﬁckers behavior may change when there is a simultaneously change in State and trafﬁckers incentives.
As it is shown, in this chapter as well as other works, when there is an increase in state incentives, with any other variables constant, this scenario increases the collusion incentives between trafﬁckers. Therefore, drug trafﬁcking and violence decreases. However, if the State and drug trafﬁckers incentives increase simultaneously; in such a way that trafﬁckers change from a cooperative to competitive behavior, then drug trafﬁcking and violence increase. This conclusion may ﬁt well in the Mexican drug ﬁght results from 2006 to 2012.
In this (model), it is only assumed that drug trafﬁckers can form two conceivable coalition structures: grand cartel when trafﬁckers agree to have full cooperation with each other; and single trafﬁckers when they decide to behave absolutely competitive against each other. I also assume that drug prices are exogenous. In future work, this model could consider applied endogenous prices
33

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT
and as a consequence the drug trafﬁcker’s behavior would be determined by the policy variables of the model.

Using equations 2.35 and 2.37 the right hand side of the above expression is positive. Therefore, State expenditure is increasing with respect to A. Now the State expenditure change with respect to B is

Notice that the term in brackets may be negative. From proposition 2.3.1, An ≥ (n − 1)BΦs assume that the condition is satisﬁed with equality. A necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for decreasing violence in the trafﬁckers structure is Φs > 2. Analogously, a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for decreasing violence in the cartel structure is Φgc > (n − 1)Φs + 2.

Proposition 2.3.2 mention that, If State punishment (international resources) increases, i.e. ∆h = hf − h0 > 0 (∆Ω < 0), where f is the ﬁnal state and 0 is the initial state, whenever πf = π0, then Zi increases; Ri and Di decrease. Vi increases, also.
Proof to Proposition 2.3.2:

Case 1: Punishment increment.It is sufﬁcient to check the inﬁnitesimal change with respect to h. Notice that

∂{yi}

=

∂{yi}

∂A ,

∂h

∂A ∂h

where {yi} is the interest vector variable, i.e.

{yi}

=

{Zi, Ri, Di, Vi}.

As

∂A ∂h

=

1 Ω

>

0, then

equations 2.39, 2.45, 2.41 and 2.43 have the same sign. Therefore, State expenditure and violence

are increasing; and individual proﬁts and drugs trafﬁc are decreasing, with respect to punishment.

Case 2: International resources increment. When international resources increase, Ω decreases. In this case, the inﬁnitesimal change, with respect to Ω, has the opposite sign to punishment because

∂{yi}

=

∂{yi}

∂A ,

∂Ω

∂A ∂Ω

and

∂A ∂Ω

=

−

h Ω2

<

0.

From equations 2.39 and 2.45, if Ω decrease, then State expenditure and

violence increase. Individual proﬁts and drugs trafﬁc decrease, by equations 2.41 and 2.43, as Ω

39

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT

decreases.

Notice that trafﬁckers expenditure decreases as State incentives increase. However, violence rates increase, this implies that total trafﬁckers expenditure decreases at a lower rate than State expenditure.

Proposition 2.3.3 mention that, If network size (drug price) increases, i.e. ∆W > 0 (∆C > 0, whenever πf = π0, then Ri and Di increase, but Zi, and Vi change is uncertain.
Proof to Proposition 2.3.3:

Case 1:

Network size increment.

In

this

case

∂B ∂W

=C

> 0, from equation 2.42, individual

proﬁts are increasing, with respect to W . However, State expenditure and violence rates change is

uncertain because equations 2.40 and 2.46 may be positive or negative. Drugs trafﬁc change with

respect to W is

∂Di ∂W

=

λmipi

+

λW

mi

∂pi ∂B

∂B ,
∂W

(2.48)

which is positive. Then drugs trafﬁc is increasing with W .

Case 2: drug price increment. This case is analogous to the previous.

Both cases show that individual proﬁts and drug trafﬁcking are increasing with W (C). However, State expenditure and violence rates change are uncertain.

Remark: If Cf > C0 and Wf < W0, such that Cf Wf > C0W0, then the change on drugs is uncertain, because

∆Di

=

(An

+

λmi Bf Φi)(An

+

B0Φi)

An(Cf Wf2 − C0W02) − ΦiCf Wf C0W0(W0 − Wf )

.

(2.49)

The term in brackets is negative when An(Bf Wf − B0W0) < ΦiBf B0(W0 − Wf ), i.e. when

40

2.8. APPENDIX 2

Bf Wf

<

B0W0

or

An

<

Φ Bf B0(W0−Wf ) i Bf Wf −B0W0

with

Bf Wf

− B0W0

>

0.

This implies

that

even

when

trafﬁckers incentives increase, reductions on the network size may decrease drug trafﬁc. However,

individual proﬁts increase.

Notice that when trafﬁckers are highly effective then violence rates decrease, as trafﬁckers incentives increase. In this case, total trafﬁckers expenditure increases but not as much as State expenditure decreases because trafﬁckers are so effective that a small increase in resources produces a big increment on fraction network.

2.8 Appendix 2
2.8.1 Alternative Deﬁnitions on Violence.
In the text, I consider that the State and trafﬁckers expenditure increase violence levels. J. Miron (1999), ﬁnd a positive relationship between homicides and enforcement expenditure in alcohol and drugs. By this reason, I assume that the total expenditure in the conﬂict is perfectly and symmetrically related with violence.
This is a strong assumption. In addition, this deﬁnition may be criticized because the main objective to the State expenditure is the enforcement on law offenders, which should reduce violence in the long run. Besides, competitive behavior increases trafﬁckers expenditure and homicides rates, but it is endogenous to the model, and it is not clear that the State can avoid it14.
In this section, I propose two alternative deﬁnitions on violence, which are extreme cases of the two critics mentioned. The ﬁrst deﬁnition considers that the State expenditure does not affect violence levels, in other words only trafﬁckers expenditure has an effect on violence15. The second deﬁnition considers that only the State expenditure affect violence, this is an extreme result of J.
14Data in homicides rates include general population homicides. There is no a direct link with trafﬁckers and State conﬂict. However, if one can assume that these homicides rates are linked with the diversiﬁcation of crime markets, then this deﬁnitions may be generalized.
15Lindo and Padilla-Romo (2015) results suggest that most of the violence is caused by trafﬁckers competition, then an alternative deﬁnition is considered only the expenditure on trafﬁckers conﬂict. In this case the result is obvious, only trafﬁckers structure has an effect on violence.

.

(2.51)

Proposition A2.1 If the coalition structure remains constant, whenever the trafﬁckers incentives increase, then violence increases.

Proof: From equation 2.51 is easy to see that it is increasing with trafﬁckers incentives, B.

Proposition A2.1 If the coalition structure remains constant, whenever the State incentives increase, then violence decreases in the trafﬁckers structure, but the effect is uncertain in the cartel structure.

Proof: From equation 2.51 the change with respect to A, is

∂V ∂A

=

m2i

B2Φi(B (An +

Φi − A) BΦi)3

.

16A better deﬁnition is to split the expenditure between trafﬁckers conﬂict and the State-trafﬁckers conﬂict and use the latter as

the violence deﬁnition. However, it is not possible to split the trafﬁckers expenditure in the trafﬁckers structure.

17The violence in the trafﬁckers and the cartel structure are,Vs

=

n2 AB2Φi (An+B Φi )2

and Vgc

=

AB 2 Φi (An+B Φi )2

,

respectively

42

2.8. APPENDIX 2
From proposition 2.3.1, this expression is negative in the trafﬁckers structure. But in the cartel structure BΦgc may be greater than An, therefore it is uncertain.
Remark A2.1 If Φs = Φgc = Φ, then violence is decreasing in both structures.
Proposition A2.3 If superadditivity technology is constant and the parameters are non-decreasing, whenever the trafﬁckers and State incentives increase simultaneously, such that coalition changes from cartel to singleton structure, then violence rates increase.
Proof: Let Φs = Φgc = Φ. Besides Af > A0 and Bf > B0, where A0 and Af are the initial and ﬁnal State incentives, respectively. Similarly, B0 and Bf are the initial and ﬁnal trafﬁckers incentives. Such that, A0 ≥ B0Φ and Af ≤ Bf Φ, then initially trafﬁckers choose the cartel structure, and in the ﬁnal state they choose the trafﬁckers structure accordingly to proposition 2.4.1. Then,

n2

Af Φn

Bf2Φ + Bf

Φ)2

>

A0B02Φ (B0Φn + B0Φ)2

≥

A0B02Φ (A0n + B0Φ)2

.

Notice that the ﬁrst expression is the violence in the trafﬁckers structure at the ﬁnal state, and the last expression is the violence in the trafﬁckers structure at the initial state. The ﬁrst and third inequalities are satisﬁed by proposition 2.4.1. Finally, the second inequality is satisﬁed because n2Af > A0.

Qualitative results are similar to the text, with this deﬁnition of violence. The main difference is that if State incentives increase, then violence decreases, in general, when everything else is constant.

Accordingly to the second alternative deﬁnition on violence, I assume that violence is not correlated with trafﬁckers expenditure, and it is perfectly correlated with State expenditure, that is

V = Z. From proposition 2.3.2 in the text, if State incentives increase, then violence does, when the coali-
43

CHAPTER 2. A SIMPLE ECONOMIC ENVIROMENT
tion structure remains constant. Proposition A2.4 If superadditivity technology is constant, and trafﬁckers behave competitively, whenever the trafﬁckers incentives increase, then violence decreases. Proof: Let Φs = Φgc = Φ. From equation 2.40, the trafﬁckers structure violence hat change is

∂Vs = An [An − BΦ(2n − 1)] ∂ps .

∂B An + BΦ

∂B

This expression is negative because trafﬁckers behave competitively, then by proposition 2.4.1, BΦ > A, therefore the term in brackets is negative.
Proposition A2.5 If superadditivity technology is constant, and trafﬁckers behave cooperatively, whenever the trafﬁckers incentives increase, then violence does.
Proof: This proof is analogous to the previous one, the difference here is that cartel structure violence hat change is

∂Vgc = A [An − BΦ] ∂pgc .

∂B An + BΦ

∂B

By proposition 2.4.1, A > BΦ, then the term in brackets is positive.

From the last two propositions, when the trafﬁckers incentives increase there is a mixed result. If trafﬁckers behave competitively, then violence decreases, but if they behave cooperatively, then violence increases. From the text, I know that the State considers the competition between trafﬁckers. Therefore, if they compete among them, then the State reduces its expenditure. Conversely, If trafﬁckers cooperate, then the State increment its expenditure.

Proposition A2.6 If superadditivity technology is constant and the parameters are non-decreasing, whenever trafﬁckers and State incentives increase simultaneously, such that there is a coalition change from cartel to singleton structure, then violence effect is uncertain.

Proof: Let Φs = Φgc = Φ. Besides Af > A0 and Bf > B0, where A0 and Af are the initial

44

2.8. APPENDIX 2

and ﬁnal State incentives, respectively. Similarly, B0 and Bf are the initial and ﬁnal trafﬁckers incentives. Such that, A0 ≥ B0Φ and Af ≤ Bf Φ, i.e. initially trafﬁckers choose the cartel structure, and in the ﬁnal state they choose the trafﬁckers structure accordingly to proposition 2.4.1.

In this case there is no an strict relationship between Vs and Vgc. In order to see this, ﬁrst assume

that Af

=

A0

and Bf

=

γB0,

with 1

<

γ

≤

, A0n
B0Φ(n−1)

such

that

Vsf

≥

Vgc0, then the following

inequality has to be satisﬁed,

γA0B0(A0n − γB0Φ(n − 1)) ≥

A02B0

(A0n + γB0Φ)2

(A0n + B0Φ)2

Let γ

=

A0n B0Φ(n−1)

then the left hand side is 0

<

A0

which contradicts the assumption.

Second,

assume that Vsf ≤ Vgc0. In this case, the inequality, in the above expression, changes of direction.

Let γ goes to one, then the inequality goes to A0 < B0Φ which is false by the initial conditions.

Moreover, by proposition A2.4 the left hand side is continuously decreasing with γ. Therefore

with

γ

=

1,

it

is

an

upper

bound,

the

lower

bound

is

achieved

when

γ

=

. A0n
B0Φ(n−1)

Notice

that

the

lower bound is 0 which is lower that Vgc0.

Now assume Af

>

A0, in this case

Af B0

<

γ

≤

. Af n
B0Φ(n−1)

By proposition 2.3.2 the left hand side

from

the inequality

is increasing,

then the

upper

bound is

higher.

But if γ

=

, Af n
B0Φ(n−1)

then the

lower bound is still 0 which is lower than Vgc0.

This proposition shows that violence may decrease even when trafﬁckers and State incentives increases. Therefore, results in the text are weaker.

Chapter 3 Conﬂict and Narcotraﬁc: A Sequential Coalition Formation Game
47

3.1 Introduction

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION

Mexico is a transit country for drugs. Mexico’s drug trafﬁckers buy most of the drugs from producer countries; then they distribute to consumer countries, especially the U.S. market. Drugs routes pass through Mexico to the US-Mexico border.
At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, Mexico involves the army in drug trafﬁcking ﬁght. In 2006, the Mexican president, Felipe Calderon declares heavier efforts in what he called a ”Drug War”. After this announcement, intentional homicides raises and trafﬁckers cartels start to fragment.
There an open debate if this policy increases violence rates by itself, or by the contrary, as a result of the policy, drug cartels fragmented and behave more violent. However, expenditure orientated to law enforcement, in prohibitionist environments, is positively correlated with an increase on intentional homicides, in the US (J Miron, 1994). Skaperdas (2010) makes a review between conﬂict and violence, in different environments. Many papers show a positive relationship between crime and drug use, but they are silent on the relationship between State efforts and crimes by the organized crime, for example UNODC (2014).
Grossman and Mej´ıa, (2007) proposes an analytical model to analyze prohibition drugs policies1. In their sequential model, drug producers, and the State engage in three conﬂicts: a) to control land; b) to destroy illicit crops; and c) to trafﬁc drugs. A generalization of this model is used to evaluate anti-drug policy in Colombia under the Plan Colombia; Mej´ıa, (2008); Mej´ıa and Restrepo (2008).
Grossman-Mej´ıa model is useful because it also allows to evaluate effects on violence; Mej´ıa at. al. (2011). Other papers assess the relationship between Mexico’s drug policy and its impact on violence and drug trafﬁcking; Dell, (2011), Rios, (2010). These papers assume that drug trafﬁckers compete between them and the State to monopolize crime in the territories where they operate. However, these studies do not consider that trafﬁckers may behave strategically, and avoid competition between them and only have a conﬂict with the State.
1Becker, at al, (2004), proposes a model to study the effects of prohibitionist policy on illegal goods with an inelastic elasticity. They also compare the effects of no prohibitionist policies outcomes
48

3.1. INTRODUCTION
Guerrero, (2011); and Rios, (2012); mention that Mexican drug cartels use to cooperate with smaller organizations in trafﬁcking activities. In journalist chronicles, this argument is very persistent. For instance Hernandez, (2012), mention that there was a truce and alliance attempt between the main maﬁa lords in Mexico, in 2007.
In this chapter, I develop a similar model as the Grossman-Mej´ıa model. I consider that there is a State that wants to reduce trafﬁcking activities. The State receives international aid, and it may punish if it does not reduce drug trafﬁc. Also, there are trafﬁckers that need routes and try to avoid State enforcement. Drug Dealers compete for trafﬁcking routes with the State and other trafﬁckers. This model allows endogenous coalition formation between trafﬁckers. Members that belong to the same coalition does not ﬁght against each other, but they ﬁght against the State and others coalition.
I show that an increase in international resources or punishment reduces trafﬁcking activities but increase violence and State’s cost, if the coalition structure does not change. This result is the expected from prohibitionist policy. However, if the coalition structure changes most of the results are uncertain.
In the model, drug prices are assumed exogenous. If the coalition structure is constant, whenever drug prices increase, drug trafﬁcking activities increase; but violence and State’s cost effect are uncertain. However, when trafﬁckers may change the coalition structure, results are unpredictable.
Mexico’s drug ﬁght data from 2000 to 2012 shows that international aid increases in 2002, and in 2008-2010 period. It also shows, that Mexico’s defense and security expenditure, decreases from 2000 to 2006, and it was until 2009 when there was a signiﬁcant increment. Intentional homicides in Mexico highly increase in 2008.
Cocaine U.S. price decreases from 2000 to 2007 after this year there was about 50% increase in 2008 with respect to 2006, UNODC (2014). The price remains almost constant at this level from 2009 to 2012.
Journalist works (e.g. Blancornelas, (2002); Osorno, (2009); (2012); Ravelo, (2011); and Hernandez, (2010)) mention that there were four major conﬂicts between Mexico’s cartels in 2003, 2004,
49

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
2008 and 2010, and it was an agreement attempt in 2007. This data may conﬁrm some conclusions of the model.
This chapter structure is the following. In Section 2, I present the model that is a three stages sequential game. In Section 3 and 4 I obtain the interior equilibrium solution and I perform a comparative statistics analysis when the coalition structure does not change. In section 5, I obtain the solution when the State does not have enough incentives to ﬁght trafﬁcking, in the third stage. I provide the solution from the game, in section 6, I also compare the total agreement solution and the no agreement solution as benchmark scenarios in this section. In Section 7, a numerical example is provided. Finally in Section 8, I conclude.
3.2 Model
The model is a three stages sequential game2. The players are an outsider which is a nature player; n drug trafﬁckers; and the State S. The outsider gives incentives to the State to ﬁght drug trafﬁcking. The outsider selects a fraction 1 − Ω of resources that it gives to the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking. The outsider also select a level of punishment h. In the second stage, trafﬁckers may form coalitions between them. In the third stage, coalitions and the State ﬁght for a drug trafﬁc network.
In the second stage, the n trafﬁckers may form coalitions according to the Bloch’s game. That is a sequential game, where players in order forms coalitions, I explain it with more detail in the second stage section. After this stage m coalitions are formed. This is one of the main difference with the previous chapter, because this protocol allows to form any kind of coalition, in other words it allows that symmetric and asymmetric coalitions can be formed.
In the third stage, the m coalitions and the State ﬁght in a contest for a drug trafﬁc network W > 0. This Network allows to trafﬁc drug to the consumer country and obtain a potential proﬁt of C > 0. Trafﬁckers need it as an input. The State wants to destroy the network.
The main difference between this chapter and the previous one is that the coalition formation
2Indeed there is at least n + 1 stages in the game, where n is the number of drug trafﬁckers. However, I describe the game as one of three stages, for simplicity
50

3.2. MODEL
protocol change, which allows to form any kind of coalition, i.e. symmetric and asymmetric coalitions can be formed. The second difference is that in this chapter, the main attention is on changes in the observer policy parameters, i.e. the fraction 1 − Ω and h. I also analyze what happen when the State does not invest. I obtain similar results as in the previous chapter because trafﬁckers may choose different coalition structures. Also, I obtain results when the State does not invest, which represent the case that the State is weak. However as there can be a lot of coalition structures and trafﬁckers may change between them, the condition when the coalition structure change is not so obvious as in the previous one.
3.2.1 Timing
The timing of the model is as follows: 1) In the ﬁrst stage the observer selects the punishment and resources that he gives to the State3. 2) In the second stage, drug trafﬁckers decide if they will form coalitions among themselves to ﬁght other cartels and the State for the drug network. 3) In the third stage, given the number of cartels that were formed previously, simultaneously the State and cartels decide the resources that will ”invest” in the conﬂict to control a fraction a trafﬁc network.
3.2.2 First Stage
In the ﬁrst stage, the outsider which is a nature player selects a fraction 1 − Ω from a uniform distribution U [0, 1]. The outsider gives resources to the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking, the conﬂict of the State is described in the third stage. The outsider gives an amount of resources Z(1 − Ω) to the State, where Z is the total expenditure in the conﬂict from the State. The outsider also select a level of punishment h from a uniform distribution U [0, h¯], where h¯ is the maximum punishment
3For example under ”Plan Merida” U.S. government offered a ﬁnancial and military help to the Mexican State with two years in advance.
51

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
for the State4.
The outsider establishes a stick and carrots strategy, in order to incentivize the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking. The carrot are the resources that he gives to the State, and the stick is the level of punishment h that the State receives if it does not reduce the drug trafﬁc.
The fraction of resources 1 − Ω and the level of punishment h is known by all players in the next stages of the game.
3.2.3 Second Stage
In the second stage, the set of n drugs trafﬁckers, who are identical in all relevant aspects, decide to form coalitions. Coalition structures are a partition from this set. Coalitions are formed with Bloch’s coalition game5, (Bloch 1996). This game has multiple stages. In the model I consider all this stages but here I described them as a single stage to abbreviate the exposition. Then it does not have any difference.
Bloch’s game gives a Coalition structure Π = {A1, A2, . . . , Am}. Note that drug trafﬁckers are identical, therefore the main difference between coalitions is the number of members. Then a coalition structure can be rewritten as π = {a1, a2, . . . , am}, where aj = |Aj| the cardinality of the set Aj6.
I assume drug trafﬁckers are completely rational, then they form cartels or stay alone in order to maximize their payoffs in the third stage.
4The otusider can not punish the State with a ﬁne that it is equal to the GNP for the State, then the punishment has an upper bound
5Bloch’s game is a sequential game of at least n stages. Where n is the number of players. In the game, the set players are ordered with a random device. In the ﬁrst stage, the ﬁrst player proposes a coalition A1 of m1 ≤ n members. The m1 players decides to accept or refuse in the order assigned, if all accept coalition A1, it is formed and the m1 players are retired from the game and it continues with the next player in the list, who proposes a coalition A2 of m2 ≤ n − m1 members. If one of them rejects, then the rejecter becomes the initiator of the next round. The game continues in this way until the last player has a coalition. Note if m is equal to 1 then a singleton is formed and the game continues.
6Two different coalition structure in Bloch’s game, Π and Π , may have the same coalition structure π. For example, let N = {1, 2, 3}, two different coalition structure under Bloch’s game are Π = {12, 3} and Π = {13, 2}, however they have the same coalition structure π = {2, 1}.
52

3.2. MODEL
3.2.4 Third stage
In the third stage, cartels and the State ﬁght for a drug trafﬁcking network W > 0, given the coalition structure π. This network represents: routes to the consumer country; corrupt agents; territories where drugs are processed, reﬁned; etc.
Trafﬁcking network is a perfect divisible private input good for cartels. The size of the networks depends on observable characteristics. For example, territories where drug trafﬁcking cartels has presence.
The State and cartels ﬁght for a network fraction. Once cartels obtain a network fraction they are able to sell drugs to the consumer country and they are the only ones that can use it, they obtain a proﬁt of C > 0 from drug trafﬁc. The State wants to destroy the network, in order to reduce the trafﬁc and the supply of drugs.
The conﬂict between cartels and the State is modeled by a standard Contest Success Function (CSF)7,

pj

=

Z+

Φj Xj
m j=1

Φj

Xj

,

(3.1)

where Xj is the resources valued in dollars that coalition j invest in the conﬂict. This Xj represents the aggregate coalition effort, formally Xj = i∈aj xi. Z is the resources valued in dollars that the State invest in the conﬂict. Φj ≡ Φ(aj) is a function that represents the effectiveness in the conﬂict of cartel j, this function depends on the group size aj.

I assume there is superadditivity technology8. In other words, trafﬁckers cooperation allows to share information between them, then they become at least as effective as they were alone, this implies that Φ(aj) is nondecreasing with the number of cartel members, aj. As well as Grossman and Mejia (2008), I assume that drug trafﬁckers are more effective in the conﬂict that the State, because they can use guerrilla strategies, then Φ(1) ≥ 1.

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION I deﬁne the intensity of the conﬂict as

j=1

(3.2)

the intensity of the conﬂict are the resources that the State and trafﬁckers effectively9 spend in the conﬂict. Intensity increases with the resources spend in the conﬂict, as well as trafﬁckers effectiveness.

There is a tradeoff between trafﬁckers group size and expenditure in the conﬂict. When trafﬁckers choose a coalition with greater group size they become more effective by the superadditivity assumption, but it reduces the number of coalitions.

3.2.5 Cartel Payoffs

At the end of the third stage, payoffs are revealed. Cartels payoffs are gained from drug sales less conﬂict cost. Given the coalition structure π, payoffs for each drug trafﬁcker i that belongs to cartel j is given by

Ri∈aj = ρCpjW − xi,

(3.4)

where ρ ∈ [0, 1] is a sharing rule between alliance members, in this (model) the sharing rule is

constant for all cartel members10, i.e.

ρ

C

is the potential annual proﬁts in dollars from

drugs sales. When aj = 1 a singleton is formed, she does not share proﬁts.

9Trafﬁckers effective expenditure is ΦjXj 10See Corcho´n and Dahm (2010) for a discussion on sharing rules

54

3.2. MODEL
3.2.6 State payoffs

Following Grossman and Mejia, (2008). The interested outsider wants to reduce the supply in the consumer country. He establishes a stick and carrot strategy to incentive the State. If the State does not ﬁght trafﬁc, it will be labeled as ”Narco-State” and will be penalized with a cost of h, by the outsider. The carrot is resources, training, intelligence reports, equipment, etc. All Resources are valuated in dollars and they represent a fraction, 1 − Ω dollars, of the State conﬂict cost.
Assume that without the State intervention the number of drugs, that could be trafﬁcked, are λW , where λ represents the potential drug that could be trafﬁcked in the network W . Potential trafﬁcking with the State intervention is

D = λ pjW

The State uses the resources from the outsider to minimize costs. The State cost is the addition of expected loss from being labeled as a ”Narco-State” plus the cost of the conﬂict with drug cartels. The State payoff is

S=

using equation 3.5, this expression is equivalent to

S = −h pj − ΩZ

(3.6)

In the last expression is assumed that the State will not receive a revenue from the fraction network that it controls.

55

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
Miron (1999), ﬁnd that law enforcement expenditure has a correlation with murders in the US. In that paper, the author explains that agents may use violence to obtain proﬁts from the black market. For this reason, I assume that State and cartel expenditure positively affects violence level, and deﬁne violence as

m
V = Z + Xj.
j

(3.7)

When the State or trafﬁckers resources increase, violence does. Coalitions have an important effect in the expenditure in violence levels. Intuitively, when players cooperate they spend less money in the conﬂict than when they do not cooperate. Therefore, violence is lower in the ﬁrst than in the second case.

3.3 Main Results

A solution for the third stage is the expenditure vector {Z, Xj, xi∈aj } and the fraction network vector that, {ps, pj}, given the coalition structure, π.
In this stage, the fraction network that cartel j controls is obtained from the First Order Conditions (FOC), from 3.4 and 3.6,

Proposition 3.3.1. Cartels get a fraction of the network if and only if

(3.9)

Moreover cartels that are more efﬁcient in the average obtain a higher network fraction.

Proof in appendix 2
Proposition 3.3.1 shows that cartels do not participate in the conﬂict if they are not effective enough, with respect to the average. Cartels that are formed are more effective than the State by assumption.
The second part of the proposition shows that cartels that are more efﬁcient, in the average, will have a higher fraction network. In other words its effective expenditure, ΦjXj, will be higher than inefﬁcient cartels.
Finally, this proposition shows that there are more cartels when trafﬁckers incentives, CW , are large.
There is at least two coalition structures that can be always formed, the degenerated coalition structure11, i.e. π = {1, 1, . . . , 1}, and the ”Grand cartel” coalition structure, i.e. π = {n}.
Remark 3.3.1. On symmetric coalition structures, i.e. π = {a, a, . . . , a} where a is constant, cartels obtain the same fraction network. Remark 3.3.2. A negative fraction is not allowed. If cartel j has a negative fraction its optimal decision is not invest and obtain 0 from the game.

The State fraction is

CWΩ ps = 1 − ψ h .

State fraction should be no negative positive, then the second term in the expression should be less

than one if it is higher than one the State does not invest and obtain a fraction of zero. This gives a condition on State incentives, such that the State ﬁghts trafﬁcking,
Proposition 3.3.2. If the State incentives are large, then it obtains a positive fraction

m−1 h ≥ aj CW Ω,
j Φj
moreover, the State always ﬁghts against the grand cartel12.

(3.11)

Proof in appendix 2
Proposition 3.3.2 shows how large need to be the incentives in order for the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking. The State ﬁghts trafﬁc when punishment or international help, 1 − Ω, are big. The inequality depends on potential revenues from the trafﬁcking network; the coalition structure; and the average effectiveness, the last two are unobserved for policy makers.
Remark 3.3.3. A sufﬁcient condition for the State to ﬁght trafﬁcking is that punishment is bigger than potential trafﬁcking proﬁts from the most efﬁcient cartel13.

From 3.8 and 3.10 is easy to obtain the intensity of the conﬂict in parameters as

I = ψCW,

(3.12)

intensity is always positive. As expected, intensity increases as cartel and State incentives do. From the deﬁnition of CSF, equation 3.1, and using 3.8 and 3.12 cartel j expenditure is

When State fraction is positive, then State expenditure is. From proposition 3.3.2 the State ﬁghts trafﬁcking when incentives are large, otherwise the State does not participate. The State always ﬁghts the grand cartel.

when fraction network, that belongs to cartel aj is positive, individual revenues are positive14. From the above expression is easy to see that individual proﬁts are decreasing with respect to ψ.

In equation 3.16 the size of the coalition has two opposite effects. On the one hand, as the coalition size increases the individual proﬁts decrease, because cartel revenues are shared with more members. On the other hand, as coalition size increases the effectiveness increases and consequently the individual proﬁts increase too. Notice that bigger cartels, may not have greater individual proﬁts then smaller cartels, as the revenues are shared with a bigger number of members.

In symmetric coalition structures, πj = {a, a, . . . , a}, all cartels participate and they obtain same individual proﬁts,

3.4 Parameters Change
In this section I do a comparative static with changes in State and trafﬁckers incentives in the third stage, In other words I assume that the second stage of the game does not exist and trafﬁckers stay in the same coalition even if incentives change. The paper from Grossman and Mej´ıa (2008) has a similar analysis, but they consider that only the singleton structure can be formed. The results on this section are similar to theirs, but in section 4.6 I show that this result may not be straightforward.
I consider what happen when international resources, punishment, potential proﬁts and the network size change and the coalition structure is constant. The ﬁrst two variables are the policy variables, the last two are the market parameters. Table 3.1 shows changes on variables with respect to the parameters. The results on the table are proved in appendix 3.

3.4.1 Policy Parameters Change

From table 3.1, if the State incentives increases, i.e. the punishment increases or the fraction Ω decreases, then the State expenditure and its fraction of the network increase. The fraction of the

15Notice that ps +

network that cartel j obtain, the drug trafﬁc and the proﬁts for cartels decrease. Finally the intensity and the violence increase.
The previous results can be interpreted as, the State controls a bigger fraction of the network, which reduces drug trafﬁc. Drug cartels engage in a conﬂict with a stronger enemy, then its expenditure may increase or decrease16. However, they lose some of their fraction network, even if their expenditure increases. As a consequence, individual proﬁts decrease, because fraction network decreases more than the trafﬁckers expenditure17. As it is expected the intensity in the conﬂict increases, because the State raises its expenditure more than cartels effective expenditure decreases. This implies that violence expands, too.

3.4.2 Market Parameters Change

Suppose that trafﬁckers incentives increase, i.e. there is an increase on C or W . In this case, cartel j fraction increases. As a result drug trafﬁc, individual proﬁts, and intensity on the conﬂict increase. However the State expenditure may increase or decrease as well as violence.

If trafﬁckers incentives increase, then cartel j expenditure increases because the potential proﬁts from the network are higher. Therefore cartel j obtains a higher fraction, which lead to a higher

≥ 2ψ, then cartel expenditure increases. In symmetric structures with two or more coalitions,

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
individual proﬁts. State expenditure may increase or decrease18, but its network fraction decreases. As a consequence drug trafﬁc increases. Intensity on the conﬂict increases, because cartels spend more and they are more effective than the State. However, violence may decrease because the State expenditure may decrease more than the increase on trafﬁckers expenditure.
These results are summarized in the following proposition Proposition 3.4.1. Suppose that trafﬁckers are not allowed to change the coalition. If State incentives increase, then drug trafﬁc and individual revenues decrease. As a collateral effect violence increases. Suppose that trafﬁckers are not allowed to change the coalition. If trafﬁckers incentives increase, then drug trafﬁc and individual revenues increase. However, violence rates may increase or decrease.
Details are in appendix 3
Results from proposition 3.4.1 are the expected from prohibition policy, but they are based on the assumption that the coalition structure is constant. Changes in the coalition structure, are analyzed in section 3.6.

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
Violence increases with the number of coalitions, as expected. Notice, that in this case the State does not ﬁght trafﬁcking it receives the punishment then payoff for the State are S = −h and drugs trafﬁc is D = λW .
3.6 Coalition Structure Choice: Degenerated and Grand Cartel Structures.
In the second stage, trafﬁckers decide the number of members which they want to collude, according to the Bloch game which is described in section 3.2. They compare the payoffs in the third stage, given each coalition structure π, and chooses the one that maximize their proﬁts. Coalition structures are a ﬁnite set, then a unique solution exist, see Bloch (1996).
Remember that in the Bloch’s game on section 4.2 the coalition structure π only has the number of players in each coalition, then the coalition structures Π = {1, 23} and Π = {13, 2} has the same coalition structure π = {1, 2}, this not make a difference because trafﬁckers are identical then the payoffs only differ in the number of members in each coalition, In other words the game is symmetric. The following examples19. Suppose that the number of players are three, then there is three coalition structure, πGC = {3}; πC = {1, 2} I call this structure the cartel structure; and πG = {1, 1, 1}20. I deﬁne the payoff vector as Rl = {R1, R2, R3} where l = {GC, C, G} and Ri with i = {1, 2, 3} is the individual payoff for player i.
1. Grand cartel choice: Assume that the payoffs are RGC = {4, 4, 4}; R1 = {5, 1, 1}; and RG = {2, 2, 2}. In this case, player 1 chooses the grand cartel and the other players accept. Player 1 does not choose a singleton coalition because the other two players becomes singletons and all players are worse than in the grand cartel.
2. Degenerated structure choice: Assume that payoffs are as in example 1, but RGC =
19These examples are not exhaustive. 20The coalition structure π = {2, 1} is not considered since it has the same payoff as πC
64

3.6. COALITION STRUCTURE CHOICE: DEGENERATED AND GRAND CARTEL STRUCTURES.
{3, 3, 3} and RG = {4, 4, 4}. In this case players does not have incentives to cooperate, because if they become singletons they obtain a higher payoff that if they stay in a coalition, then player 1 chooses a singleton as well as player 2, and the degenerated structure is formed.
3. Cartel structure choice : Assume that payoffs are as in example 1, but R1 = {5, 3, 3}. In this case, player 1 chooses a singleton since he knows that the two-member coalition has a higher payoff than degenerated structure. Player 2, proposes a two-member coalition to player 3 because she does not have incentives to deviate a form the degenerated structure, then πC is formed.
4. Last player is excluded : Assume that payoffs are as in example 1, but R1 = {0, 5, 5}. In this case, player 1 proposes a two members coalition to player 2, whose does not have incentives to reject. Player 3 cannot block this action then he becomes a singleton and the coalition structure, πC, is formed in the equilibrium.

Remark : Notice that the degenerated structure can be formed, always.
These examples show that the last player receives the worst payoff and players requires to be non myopic21.
Bloch’s game equilibrium solution is found by backward induction. If player n − 122, has not a coalition, he proposes a coalition of two members to player n, if his payoffs are higher than being a singleton. If player n − 2 has not a coalition, she proposes a coalition of three members if her payoffs are higher than being a singleton, or if players n − 2 and n − 1 cannot obtain higher payoffs when they excludes the last player, and so on.
In general, given coalitions a1, a2, . . . , al−1 that were formed, player j − th23 proposes a coalition al of n − j members and the coalition structure π = {a1, a2, . . . , al−1, al} is formed, if

(c) The remaining players cannot form a different coalition structure π , where they are at least equal than in π∗, and player j − th is worst. That is, in the subset of players {n − j − al∗},

Condition (c) rules out situations where players can form another coalition that makes the set of players belonging to al∗ worst. For example, suppose that there are ten players, RGC = 3 and RG = 1. Also, assume that π = {4, 6} has payoffs of Rπ = {5, . . . , 5, 2, 2, . . . , 2}, which are greater than the grand cartel and degenerated structure, respectively. Player 1 may propose a coalition of four members. However, player 5 and player 8 may propose a coalition of three members each, i.e. they form the coalition π = {4, 3, 3} with payoffs of Rπ = {0, . . . , 0, 5, . . . , 5}. The

remaining six players are better, and the payoff of 0 is worse than the grand cartel, then player 1 never will choose a four-member alliance.
Above, the grand cartel and the degenerated structure has a very important role. These structures also represents the total cooperation and total competition24 cases, respectively. As these coalitions represent limit cases have a special interest.

3.6.1 Degenerated Coalition Structure

Let that the alliance structure be given by πG = {1, 1, . . . , 1}. In other words, it is the case of full competition, players not cooperate and m = n. Each trafﬁcker controls the same fraction network and spend the same in the conﬂict. Then, they obtain the same individual revenues,

3.6.3 Total Agreement and No Agreement: High State Incentives
In the second stage, trafﬁckers choose the coalition structure. Consider the case of the equation 3.11 in proposition 3.3.2, which is satisﬁed.
The trafﬁckers payoffs only differ on the size of the coalition. Then players adopt the same strategy at each node of the sequential game in the second stage25. Bloch (1996), shows that the sequential equilibrium in this kind of games exists, is not empty and unique. Therefore trafﬁckers form only one coalition structure in the second stage.
I do not analyze the set of sequential equilibriums, because it has many coalitions that can be formed and comparative statics require speciﬁc examples. Instead, In this section I analyze two coalition that can be formed with any number of players n, that is the grand cartel and the degenerated structure, as an example of what happen when the coalition structure change. This analysis gives intuition of what happen in the general case when a trafﬁckers decide to change from one coalition structure to other with a bigger number of coalitions. However, the grand cartel and the
25Bloch (1996), deﬁned this kind of games as symmetric games.
68

3.6. COALITION STRUCTURE CHOICE: DEGENERATED AND GRAND CARTEL STRUCTURES.
degenerated structure below may not be the equilibrium outcome. The equilibrium otucomes in the case of three agents are obtained in the next section where a numerical example is developed.
Trafﬁckers prefer the grand cartel if the following condition is satisﬁed.

Proof in appendix 2 Above proposition establish that, if State incentives are large26, then trafﬁckers prefer collusion and they form the grand cartel because they expect a strong enemy. If superadditivity technology is constant, i.e. Φ(1) = Φ(n) = Φ, then the condition simpliﬁes to

h ≥ CW Φ.
Ω This condition satisﬁes equation 3.11 in proposition 3.3.2.
Proposition 3.6.2. If grand cartel efﬁciency is less than the number of players, then drug trafﬁc and violence rates are higher in the degenerated structure than in the grand cartel structure.

Proof in appendix 2
Propositions 3.6.1 and 3.6.2 mention that, if equation 3.11 is satisﬁed, whenever State incentives are large, then trafﬁckers cooperate which implies that trafﬁc and violence rates are low. Therefore, If State incentives increase, such that trafﬁckers change from a competitive behavior to a cooperative behavior, then drugs trafﬁc decreases. Violence may decrease, also.
26In other words, h is big and/or Ω is small.
69

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
3.6.4 Total Agreement and No Agreement: Low State Incentives

Here I compare the grand cartel and the degenerated structures, but I assume that equation 3.11 is not satisﬁed. Remember that the State always ﬁghts the grand cartel, but it does not ﬁght trafﬁckers in the degenerated structure when incentives are low. In this case, trafﬁckers may ﬁght among them because the State does not participate and they do not share their proﬁts.

Proposition 3.6.3. If equation 3.11 is not satisﬁed, then trafﬁckers prefer the grand cartel to the degenerated structure when

(n − 1)C2W 2Φ(n)2 ≥

h 2h n + CW nΦ(n) [3 − n] .

Ω

Ω

Proof in appendix 2

This condition is satisﬁed when State incentives are very low, i.e. h is small and Ω goes to one, but as State incentives increase this condition may not be true. In other words, as Bn → (n − 1)AΦ(1) players have more incentives to behave competitively.

Notice that the second term, in brackets, in the right hand side is negative for four or more players.

Also,

notice

that

n.

When

the

number

of

players

is

big

and grand cartel effectiveness is big, the most probable outcome is that the grand cartel dominates

the degenerated structure in the low incentives case.

Proposition 3.6.4. If equation 3.11 is not satisﬁed, whenever the grand cartel efﬁciency is lower than the number of players, then violence in degenerated structure is higher than violence in grand cartel.

Proof in appendix 2
Propositions 3.6.3 and 3.6.4 tells that, If State incentives are very low, then trafﬁckers behave cooperatively. When State incentives increase, trafﬁckers may change their behavior and be competitive, as a result, violence and trafﬁc27 escalate.
27If (n − 1)AΦ(1) > Bn, drugs trafﬁc in the degenerated structure is DG = λW , always. This trafﬁc level is higher than DGC .
70

3.7. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
3.6.5 Remarks

Propositions 3.6.1 to 3.6.4 tells that, if State incentives are very low, then players prefer to behave

cooperatively.

When

State

incentives

increase,

such

that

h Ω

<

CW Φ(n),

trafﬁckers

change

their

behavior and become competitive. As a result, drugs trafﬁc and violence rates expand. Finally, if

State

incentives are such

that

h Ω

>

CW Φ(n),

trafﬁckers

behavior changes again

and they prefer

cooperate, which reduces trafﬁc and violence.

In this section, I show that increments in State incentives are not always a good idea because players may become more competitive. This expands drug trafﬁc and violence rates.

As I said above, grand cartel and degenerated structure are not the only structures that may form, but this analysis gives an idea of what happen in the general solution.

3.7 Numerical Example

In this section, I develop an example the main objective is to show the results when trafﬁckers are allowed to change between coalition structures. In this example, there are three drug trafﬁckers. In the second stage drug trafﬁckers decide to form one of the following coalition structures: the degenerated coalition structure πG = {1, 1, 1}; the cartel coalition structure πC = {2, 1}; and the grand cartel coalition structure πGC = {3}. Let the punishment be h = 0.36 and the technology, Φ(aj) = 1.5 ∗ aj28.

Figure 3.1 shows: individual trafﬁckers proﬁts; State’s expenditure; Total violence; and Drug trafﬁcking, at different levels of State’s proportion resources, i.e. Ω, and at each coalition structure. Green, blue and red lines represent grand cartel, degenerated and cartel coalition structures, respectively. Continuous lines indicated the equilibrium path where trafﬁckers chose a particular coalition structure. Notice that the Degenerated coalition structure is never an equilibrium, for this example.

28Note that Φ(aj) is increasing with respect to the number of members in the coalition, and the average effectiveness, i.e.

Φ(aj aj

)

,

is constant.

71

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENTIAL COALITION FORMATION
Figure 3.1: Variables changes when State’s resources proportion changes
Figure 3.1 has two red lines, the circle (o) line represents proﬁts for the two members coalition, and triangles ( ) represents proﬁts for the singleton, on the cartel structure. In this ﬁgure, cartel structure is chosen for a State’s fraction resources between 0.33 and 0.48, while grand cartel structure is chosen for all other fractions, Ω < 0.33 and Ω > 0.48. This implies that there is two coalition structure change at Ω = 0.33 and Ω = 0.48. Figure 3.1 illustrate results on propositions 3.6.1 to 3.6.4. When international resources are small trafﬁckers prefer a full cooperation agreement. When external resources are in the middle, trafﬁckers ﬁght among them and the full cooperation agreement is broken. Finally when resources are big, trafﬁckers prefer the full cooperation agreement again, because the State is too strong. This ﬁgure 3.1 shows that when the Ω fraction increases such that trafﬁckers change from the grand cartel to cartel structure, then State expenditure decreases, but drug trafﬁcking and violence have a big increment because of the coalition structure change. It also shows the opposite result when trafﬁckers change from the grand cartel to the cartel structure. When an increase on parameters do not involve a coalition structure changes, then the results are
72

3.8. CONCLUSION
as described in section 3.4. State’s expenditure and violence increase, whereas drug trafﬁcking and trafﬁckers proﬁts decrease.
3.8 Conclusion
In this chapter I develop a model with endogenous coalition formation with contest success functions. I use Bloch’s sequential for coalition formation. With this game any coalition structure can be formed in the sequential equilibrium.
This model allows to analyze drug ﬁght policy. I show that an increment in State incentives reduces drug trafﬁc, but increases violence rates, whenever the coalition structure is constant. However, when the coalition structure may change, small increments in State incentives, have uncertain results. In this case, there are two effects, on one hand as the State incentives increase, trafﬁckers prefer collusion. On the other hand, State cost increases, then trafﬁckers may prefer smaller coalitions because State’s cost is higher. In other words trafﬁckers fragment to deal with a weaker enemy. As a ﬁnal result violence expands. This result is unexpected by the policy.
When State incentives increase signiﬁcantly trafﬁckers collude, then drug trafﬁc decreases nonlinear, but violence may increase because the State is more intensive in the conﬂict.
In chapter 2, Mexico’s drug ﬁght data shows that State and trafﬁckers incentives increase after 2008. This data also shows that Mexico’s expenditure in national security increases in 2009; cartels fragment from 2008 to 2010; and homicides change rates are highly positive after 2008. Model predictions are consistent with those facts. However, cocaine supply indicators for the U.S. market, increase from 2000 to 2008, and decrease from 2008 to 2012, UNODC (2013). The model expects the contrary effect. This may be due because trafﬁckers diversify the drug markets and strong assumptions on the model as the exogenous prices.
Future works need to relax the exogenous drug price assumption because drug policies may affect drug prices. Then, an increase in State’s incentives may increase deviation proﬁtability. Therefore, violence and drug trafﬁcking activities may increase as a result of the policy.

and the result in the proposition is straighted forward.

Proof to proposition 5. The ﬁrst part of proposition 3.6.2 establishes that DG − DGC > 0, from equations 3.26 and 3.29 it is sufﬁcient to show that

Bn (nΦ(1) − Φ(n)) + AΦ(1)Φ(n)(n − 1) > 0.

If Φ(n) < n, then this condition is satisﬁed, always.

The second part of the preposition establishes that VG − VGC > 0. From 3.27 and proposition 3.3.2

VG

Proposition 3.4.1 mentions that violence increases with State incentives.

3.11. APPENDIX 2

Bn (Bn + 2AΦ(n) − AΦ(1)Φ(n)) + A2 Φ(n)2 − Φ(n)Φ(1) > 0.
Using condition in proposition 3.3.2 and the assumption that Φ(n) ≥ Φ(1), then Bn + 2AΦ(n) > AΦ(1)(n − 1) + 2AΦ(n) > AΦ(1)(n + 1). Hence the above expression is greater or equal to,

AΦ(1)Bn ((n + 1) − Φ(n)) + A2 Φ(n)2 − Φ(n)Φ(1) .

This expression is positive because Φ(1) ≤ Φ(n) < n.

Proof to proposition 3.6.3. It is required to compare the grand cartel and degenerated proﬁts, in

the

low punishment

case,

equations 3.28

and 3.23

respectively.

then

the condition is

Simplifying this expression I obtain the condition in proposition 3.6.3.

Proof to proposition 3.6.4.

This proposition establishes that if (n − 1)AΦ(1) > Bn, then VG − VGC > 0. From 3.24, violence

in

the

degenerated

structure

is

VG

n−1 n

A,

from

3.30

is

sufﬁcient

to

show

that

nABΦ(n) [(n − 1)AΦ(n) − Bn] + Bn [Bn(n − 1) + 2(n − 1)AΦ(n) − BnΦ(n)] > 0.
by the low incentives condition, (n − 1)AΦ(1) > Bn, we know that 2(n − 1)AΦ(n) > 2Bn. The ﬁrst term in the left hand side is positive by the low incentives condition, (n − 1)AΦ(1) > Bn, and this condition implies that 2(n − 1)AΦ(n) > 2Bn, then the second term is positive, also.

This result implies that if the cartel j is the most efﬁcient, then it ﬁghts harder when State incentives increase.

Notice that, for all symmetric structures with more than one coalition, i.e. π = a, a, . . . , a and m ≥

State expenditure is increasing with respect to State incentives because both the fraction and intensity increase.

Individual trafﬁckers proﬁts 3.4 depend on trafﬁckers incentives A, the size of the coalition aj and the fraction ψ. Individual proﬁts are positively related with trafﬁckers incentives because trafﬁckers incentives directly increase revenues and decrease the fraction ψ. Conversely, individual proﬁts are negatively related with State incentives, because the fraction ψ increases.

Violence 3.18, depends on State and total trafﬁckers expenditure. Here changes, with respect to the incentives, are no so obvious because expenditure effects have opposite directions. The change on violence with respect to trafﬁckers incentives, A, is

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY
Sanchez Pages (2006) shows that conﬂict leading to private property rights can be ex-ante Pareto superior to free access to a resource when the number of agents is large enough. In this chapter, instead, we analyze the possibility of appearance of private property as result of a game between private agents. We focus on the relationship between value of the resource, conﬂict, and the appearance of private property, and analyze its sensibility to changes in the population size.
We analyze the agents’ incentives for obtaining private property in Grossman’s (2001)2 model on the appearance of property rights. As in Sanchez Pages (2007), “free access” is an agreement (i.e. coalition) between all agents to share collectively a valuable resource. Then private property appears as a rational deviation3 from this agreement.
In this framework we show that the value of the resource has a non monotonic effect on the emergence of private property. More speciﬁcally, when the resource is sufﬁciently valuable, agents have an incentive to leave the free access agreement. However, if the value of the resource increases enough, deviations from the free access agreement lead to a very costly conﬂict so in order to avoid it, agents stick to the agreement. Therefore we show that private property of the resource is only sustainable for intermediate values of the resource.
Increases in the number of agents have also a non monotonic effect. We show that the set of parameter values for which “free access” agreement is unstable (i.e. private property appears as equilibrium) increases with the number of agents in a small enough economy, but it could get reduced when the number of agents is large enough.
Umbeck (1981) presents a theoretical investigation of how the initial distribution of property rights can arise starting from a situation of free access. Each agent can use labor time in violence to appropriate land or in getting gold. The marginal rate of substitution between land and labor in the production of gold is a measure of how much labor is willing to allocate to maintain the exclusivity of a marginal unit of land. The equilibrium allocation of land would be characterized to equal willingness to ﬁght (and no conﬂict). In a symmetric model, the equal willingness to
2Grossman (2001) presents a General Equilibrium model in which by making an effort people can obtain private property from a common pool of a valuable resource. The resource appropriated is used, together with labor, for production activities. Then he characterizes what would be the equilibrium allocation of private efforts to obtain property.
3Our concept of stability is based on Bloch (1996). See Bolgomolnaia and Jackson (2002), Chwe (1994) and Ray and Vohra (2015) for a discussion on stability.

4.1. THE MODEL
allocate labor to conﬂict implies an equal distribution of land.
This research is related with the literature of conﬂict with coalition formation summarized in Bloch (2009), and the corresponding sections in Garﬁnkel and Skaperdas (2007). On the other hand, our research is complementary to the literature on the appearance of property rights (see Alchian and Demsetz, 1973, Demsetz, 1967, and Grossman, 2001, among others).
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic model. Section 3 analyzes formation of property rights in a three agent economy. Section 4 analyzes coalition formation with exogenous responses. Section 5 presents some results when the process of coalition formation is endogenous. Section 6 analyzes the change in the equilibrium coalition structure when the number of agents changes. Finally section 7 presents some conclusions.
4.1 The Model
Assume that there is a valuable resource (i.e. a pool of “land”) of size 1 in a n agent economy. Let N = {1, 2, . . . , n} denote the set of players. Players are identical. Each agent i has a stock of time of size 1 that can be used in production and appropriative activities. Agents can participate individually or collectively in these activities.
A coalition structure π = [{A1, A2, . . . , Ak}] is a partition of the set N . In other words, in a coalition structure each Am ⊂ N , Am ∩ Aˆq = ∅ and the union of all this coalitions ∪mk Am is equal to the set N .
Since all players are assumed to be identical, payoffs for each player are dependent on the group size rather than on the speciﬁc players that are in the group (i.e. the game is symmetric in the sense of Bloch, 1996). Let am = |Am| be the cardinality of the coalition m, that also denotes the size of that alliance. Therefore we characterize a coalition structure by π = [{a1, a2, . . . , ak}] which only depends on the number of members that are in each alliance4. From now on, i denotes the player
4Note that with this notation there could be more than one partition of N that gives the same coalition structure. For example, suppose there are three players, N = {1, 2, 3}, two different partition of this set are [{12|3}] and [{13|2}], but both of them has the same coalition structure π = [{2, 1}].
87

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY
and m the alliance am to which she belongs.
Agents that participate individually have a group size of am = 1, and members that participate collectively has a group size am > 1. Each agent i that belongs to the alliance am divides her available time in production (lim) and appropriative activities (eim). For each agent, assume that 1 = lim+eim is satisﬁed. Then in a coalition am production time is the sum of individual production time from each member (Lm = i∈am lim). Analogously, coalition appropriative effort is the sum of individual effort within the coalition (Em = i∈am eim).
We assume the particular following functional form for appropriated land for a given coalition m,


 rm =


i∈m eim/(

k m=1

i∈m eim) if

k m=1

otherwise

i∈m eim > 0

(4.1)

in which the amount appropriated depends on the relative coalition effort on appropriative activities. This functional form is a trivial extension of the Grossman’s (2001) form to an economy with coalitions.5

We consider a sequential game of two stages. In the second stage, coalitions are formed. In

the second stage, agents decide how much time to spent in appropriative eim and productive lim

activities, given the coalition structure. The beneﬁt that the alliance gets from productive activities

From the solution of the maximization of problem (4.2) we obtain the following lemma. Lemma 4.1.1. In equilibrium, players that belong to the same alliance make the same appropriative effort, eim and offer the same productive labor supply lim.

Proof: See the appendix.
From now on we omit the subindex i for eim = em and lim = lm since it only depends on the alliance that each player belongs. Lemma 1 also implies that Lm = amlm and Em = amem. Then if two different alliances p and q have the same group size the level of efforts will be the same.

We can also show that, given a coalition structure, a Nash equilibrium in efforts exists. Lemma 4.1.2. Given the coalition structure π, for 0 < α < 1,there is a Nash equilibrium e∗ = (e1∗, e∗2, . . . , e∗k) and l∗ = (l1∗, l2∗, . . . , lk∗) corresponding to the second stage of the game.

Proof: See the appendix.

4.2 A Three Agent Economy.
We fully work the process of coalition formation in a three agent economy in order to illustrate one of the main insights of the model. In the examples we use the letters a, b, c, . . . to denote the players and make explicit what are the coalitions.
7See proof of 4.1.1 in the appendix.

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY
4.2.1 Efforts and Utilities for Each Coalition Structure
The possible coalition structures are [{a, b, c}], [{a, bc}]8, and [{abc}]. The ﬁrst (degenerate coalition structure) occurs when the tree agents make individual appropriation efforts. The second coalition structure occurs when an agent makes individual appropriation efforts and the other two make collective appropriation efforts. The third coalition is the grand coalition implies a free access agreement between the three agents. In the ﬁrst and second cases private property arises and the valuable resource is divided in parts from which agents can exclude non coalition members.
We start computing utilities corresponding to the grand coalition [{abc}]. In this case, appropriation efforts are zero for each agent and the resource is shared and exploited among the three agents. Then, given the parameter values, each agent i has a payoff of

Ui[{abc}] = UG = (1/3)α.

Remark 4.2.1. A particularly interesting value α = 0.348 is obtained as a solution of the system of three equations (4.6) and (4.7) and UG = Us in α. It is easy to show (see table 4.2) that for numerical values α < 0.348, UG is larger than Us. However for α > 0.348 this inequality is reversed. The immediate consequence is that for low values of α it does not pay for agent s to deviate from the grand coalition.
9The solution from the system of equations for general values of α can be obtained by using Lemma 3 presented in section 6.
91

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY
Remark 4.2.2. Another interesting value is α = 0.549 which is obtained as the solution of the system of three equations (4.6) and (4.7) and U2 = Ud in α. It is easy to show (see table 4.2) that for α less than 0.549, U2 > Ud, and that for α greater than 0.549, U2 < Ud. Therefore, for large enough α, doing private appropriation efforts is better than doing efforts in a coalition, when an agent deviates from the free access agreement.
Remark 4.2.3. A trivial observation is that the grand coalition structure is always better for each agent than the degenerate coalition structure (i.e. UG > Ud) for every value of α.
4.2.2 The Sequential Equilibrium
We ﬁnd equilibrium coalition structures as the result of a game of sequential coalition formation10. Following Bloch (1996), in a symmetric game, a perfect equilibrium coalition structure can be reached as the outcome of a ﬁnite game of choice of coalition sizes. In the Bloch’s game, an exogenous protocol sets an order on agents. The ﬁrst player proposes a coalition size. All the prospective members of the coalition respond in turn to the offer. If all the agents accept the offer, the cooperative agreement takes effect and they leave the game. If one of the agents rejects the offer, the proposed coalition is not formed and the agent that rejected the offer becomes the initiator in the next round.
Remark 4.2.4. Private property is sustainable as a perfect equilibrium coalition structure for intermediate values of α (i.e 0.348 < α < 0.549). For the rest of the values of α the grand coalition is the only perfect equilibrium coalition structure.
Proof of the remark: For α small (i.e. α < 0.348) no individual agent has incentives to deviate from the grand coalition as U2 < Ud < Us < UG, so the grand coalition is the only stable coalition structure.
Consider now intermediate values of α (i.e 0.348 < α < 0.549). In the 3 agent economy the Bloch’s protocol could choose randomly any player. Without loss of generality assume that it is player s. As Us > UG, and U2 > Ud (so, upon its deviation, the other two players would stick
10Following a bargaining protocol as proposed by Bloch (1996) and Ray and Vohra (1999).
92

4.3. COALITION FORMATION WITH EXOGENOUS RESPONSES.
together in a complementary coalition), player s would rationally offer a coalition of size one that is accepted and the coalition is formed. In the second stage, one of the remaining players (1 or 2) offers a coalition of size two that is accepted by the other agent ( as U2 > Ud for the corresponding values of α) and the coalition is formed. Then the coalition structure [{2,1}] arises.
Assume now that we are in the region α > 0.549. In the ﬁrst stage player s will not offer a coalition size of one as it knows that U2 < Ud and upon its deviation from the grand coalition, the rest of players will become singletons (and UG > Ud). Therefore the grand coalition is an equilibrium structure.
As α is an index of the value of the resource (the share of the resource in production), the conclusion of this section is that private property is only sustainable as a perfect equilibrium coalition structure for intermediate values of the resource. Unless the resource is sufﬁciently valuable, agents do not have incentives to deviate from the free access agreement. If the value of the resource increases enough, deviations from the free access agreement are too costly in terms of conﬂict.
4.3 Coalition Formation with Exogenous Responses.
We say that a coalition structure is stable if no member can unilaterally o collectively deviate. Testing stability is difﬁcult as we would need to specify the responses of the other members of a coalition once a member o group of members deviated.
Hart and Kurz (1983) present two models of stability11 that assume two types of responses of members of a coalition once a member deviates. Each model corresponding to a coalition game, and in each one stability is based on the strong equilibria concept. The ﬁrst one called the γ game and corresponds to the case in which each agent chooses the coalition to which she wants to belong, and a coalition forms if all its members have chosen to form it. The players not belonging to these unanimous consent coalitions become singletons. This means that if a player leaves a given coalition, the rest of the players become singletons (the coalition breaks). As Hart and Kurz claim, this game is supported by the view of coalitions as the result of an unanimous agreement
11Also analyzed in Bloch, 2012, for the particular case of contests by coalitions
93

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY

among all its members to act together. Then, if one of the players leave, the agreement breaks down.
The second is called the δ game and corresponds to the case in which each player chooses the largest set of players he is willing to be associated with in the same coalition. Coalitions are formed among all the players that choose to be in the same coalition. In Hart and Kurz’s words “a coalition corresponds to an equivalence class, with respect to equality of strategies”. This means that if a player leaves a given coalition, the rest of the members form one new coalition. As Hart and Kurz claim, this model is justiﬁed specially in large games in which the fact that a player leaves a coalition has no inﬂuence in the others agreement to act together.
We characterize stable coalition structure for each of the games proposed by Hart and Kurz.
Obviously, when deciding her appropriation effort the agent has to consider that the rest of the agents would also make appropriating efforts to keep some of the land. Otherwise the single agent would keep all the land. To analyze the appropriating efforts in the economy we have to compute the reaction functions of the deviating agent and also of the agents remaining in the coalition.
Proposition 4.3.1. Assume that we are in the δ model (i.e. upon a deviation by one agent from the grand coalition the rest of agents remain in a complementary coalition). There is a ﬁnite n¯ such that for any n ≥ n¯ the grand coalition is not stable for any 0 < α < 1.

Proof: See appendix.
This proposition establish that if we are in the δ model deﬁned by Hart, S. and Kurz, M. (1983) private property would be sustainable for a large enough number of agents. Proposition 4.3.2. Assume that we are in the γ model (i.e. upon a deviation by one agent from the grand coalition the rest of agents become singletons). The grand coalition is stable.

4.4. ENDOGENOUS COALITION FORMATION
4.4 Endogenous Coalition Formation

In the general case with an arbitrary number of agents, closed form solutions for the strategies and utilities associated to each coalition structure are impossible to obtain. This is only possible for particular coalition structures. One of them is a coalition structure that divides the set of agents into two. The other is for symmetric coalition structures.

A closed form solution can be obtained when the alliance structure is π = [{c, s}] where s is an

Proof: See the appendix.
A symmetric coalition structure cannot be an equilibrium of the game of sequential coalition formation.

Proposition 4.4.1. A symmetric coalition structure is strictly dominated by the grand coalition 95

4.5 The Role of Changing the Number of Players
The closed form computation of coalitional equilibria with arbitrary number of agents is impossible as the number of coalitions to be considered is also arbitrary.
We analyze the role of changing the number of agents by computing equilibrium coalitions for economies with different number of agents. We detail the computation of equilibria when the number of agents are four and ﬁve. Three important conclusions are obtained. The ﬁrst is that the non-monotonic effect of changing the α holds. The second is the appearance of new equilibrium coalition structures that would imply different private property regimes. The third is a non-monotonic effect of changing the number of agents on the size of the set of α for which the grand coalition is stable.

4.5.1 Four and Five Agent Example
In the four agent example the possible coalition structures are [{a, b, c, d}], [{a, b, cd}], [{ab, cd}], [{a, bcd}] and [{abcde}]. We omit the coalition structures that have associated the same payoff. In the ﬁrst stage players compare ﬁve possible outcomes. Table 4.3 shows the utility levels for each coalition structure at different levels of α, Ua denotes the utility for player 1, Ub denotes the utility for player 2, and so on. Remark 4.5.1. Private property is sustainable as a perfect equilibrium solution for low values of

α, (i.e α ≤ 0.493). If α > 0.493], then the perfect equilibrium coalition structure is the grand coalition, π = [{abcd}].
Proof of the remark:
First notice that the grand coalition dominates two and three members coalition strategies. Hence player a never proposes a two or three-member coalition. In the following analysis we do not consider these strategies.
If α ≤ 0.073, then player a proposes to form the grand coalition and all players receive the same payoff. If she deviates and chooses to form a singleton, then player b forms a singleton also. Player c offers a two-member coalition to player d which is accepted because the payoffs for the twomember in [{a, b, cd}] are bigger than those corresponding to the degenerated coalition structure. In the coalition structure in [{a, b, cd}] player a receives Ua[{a,b,cd}] which is lower than the payoff corresponding to the grand coalition.
If 0.74 ≥ α ≤ 0.492, player a chooses to form a singleton. Player b proposes a three-member coalition to players c and d, which is accepted. Notice that Player b never proposes a two-member coalition because the payoffs are lower than in the three-member coalition. If player b deviates to a one-member coalition, then player c and d become singletons, and all players would receive the degenerated coalition structure payoff which is lower than Ub[{a,bcd}]. Therefore player b would not deviate (and symmetrically, neither c nor d) and, as player a receives her best payoffs, she does not deviate.
If 0.493 ≥ α, then player a chooses the grand coalition again which is accepted by all players. Notice that for these values of α the degenerated structure dominates coalitions with three and two members if a singleton is formed. Therefore, if player a deviates and chooses to play alone, then players b to d do the same and all of them receive the degenerated payoff. Hence player a does not deviates.
The ﬁve agent case is analyzed similarly. Table 4.4 shows the perfect equilibrium coalitions structures for given values of α in the ﬁve agent example. There are only four equilibrium coalition structures.

CHAPTER 4. PRIVATE AND COMMUNAL PROPERTY
Remark 4.5.2. Private property is sustainable as a perfect equilibrium solution for intermediate values of α, (i.e 0.081 ≤ α ≤ 0.469). If α ∈ (0.469, 0.566], then the perfect equilibrium coalition structure is π = [{ab, cde}]. Finally for the rest of values of α the grand coalition is the perfect equilibrium coalition structure.
Proof of the remark: If α ≤ 0.081, then player a does not have incentives to deviate from the grand coalition. Player a never deviates and chooses a coalition of size two, three, or four; because the grand coalition gives a higher payoff. If player a deviates and chooses a coalition of size one, then player b and d offer a size two coalition which is accepted by player c and e, respectively, because Ub[{a,bc,de}] > Ub[{a,b,c,de}] and Ub[{a,bc,de}] > Ub[{a,b,c,d,e}]. Hence player a obtains a payoff of Ua[{a,bc,de}] which is worse than Ua[{abcde}]. Player b does not choose a coalition of size one because he knows that the next three players would choose to form a singleton in that case. He never offers a three or four-member coalition because this gives lower payoffs than the grand coalition.
If 0.081 < α ≤ 0.469, then player a prefers to be a singleton, and player b proposes a four-member coalition which is accepted. If player b deviates and proposes a one-member coalition, then the other three player choose a singleton, and all players obtain the degenerated payoff which is worse than Ub[{a,bcde}]. If he proposes a two-member coalition to player c, then the proposal is rejected because players d and e become a singleton as Ud[{a,bc,d,e}] > Ud[{a,bc,de}], and player b and c receives a lower payoff than Ub[{a,bcde}]. He never proposes a three-member coalition because his payoff would be worse than the degenerated coalition structure payoffs. Player a does not have incentives to deviate as Ua[{a,bcde}] is the best payoff for her.
If 0.469 < α ≤ 0.566, player a proposes a two-member alliance to player b who accepts, and player c proposes a three-member coalition which is accepted by players d and e. If player c deviates and chooses a singleton then players d and e prefer to be singletons, and they obtain Uc[{ab,c,d,e}] < Uc[{ab,cde}]. This player never proposes a two-member coalition because it gives a lower payoff as Uc[{ab,cd,e}] < Uc[{ab,cde}]. Player a never chooses a coalition of three, four or ﬁve members, because it gives lower payoffs in any structure that it is formed. If she deviates and chooses a singleton, then the remaining players become singletons too, and the degenerated structure is formed which gives worse payoffs than π = [{ab, cde}]. In the case that player a
100

4.5. THE ROLE OF CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS
chooses to form a singleton, player b never chooses a two, three or four members coalition because if it is accepted, the remaining players become singletons and then they obtain lower payoffs. The same argument applies for players c and d.
If 0.566 < α ≤ 1 then the grand coalition is formed again. Player a never deviates and chooses a coalition of three or four members because it gives lower payoffs than the grand coalition. If she deviates and chooses to form a singleton, then all the players have more incentives to become singletons too, and they obtain the payoff corresponding to the degenerate coalition structure which is lower than the grand coalition payoff. If she deviates and chooses a two-member coalition then the offer is rejected, because if it is accepted then the remaining players prefer to be singletons since Uc[{ab,c,d,e}] > Uc[{ab,cde}] > Uc[{ab,cd,e}]. Players’ strategies are symmetric so the same arguments apply for the rest of the players.
The two remarks show that private property is sustainable as a perfect equilibrium for intermediate values of α. Another conclusion is that if the number of agents increases there are new equilibria that neither imply strictly private property nor common land. In this example, the grand coalition is a perfect equilibrium structure for a greater set of values of α, than in the tree agents example.
Table 4.5, shows the α values for which the grand coalition is a perfect equilibrium structure in the sequential coalition formation game, as the number of agents increases. We calculate the perfect equilibrium, from n = 3 to n = 8, as described previously. In the table, we can see that the values of α for which the grand coalition is a perfect equilibrium is non monotonic.
Table 4.5: Values of α¯, such that for α ≥ α¯, the Grand Coalition is a Perfect Equilibrium in a Sequential Coalition Formation Game

In this section, we conclude that as the number of players increases, private property is sustainable for intermediate values of α and there are new forms of property that are neither strictly private nor

common property in the equilibrium12.
4.6 Final Remarks
The chapter contributes to the literature on the foundations of private property rights by setting a model in which private property rights can emerge as an equilibrium allocation. The chapter analyzes conditions such that private property arises as equilibrium in the model by Grossman (2001). For private property to arise as coalitional equilibrium, the resource has to be valuable enough to incentive some agents to do private appropriation efforts on the resource. However, if the resource is too valuable then too many agents will be doing appropriation efforts and too much effort in conﬂict is wasted in equilibrium. This can make not worthwhile to attain private property rights on the resource for any agent. Our (model) would imply that, as in Demsetz (1967), increases in the value of land lead to the appearance of private property. However, if land value increases too much then the appearance of private property is through too much conﬂict. The loss of resources can be large enough and could make the appearance of private property not desirable for any of the individuals. The implication is that the appearance of private property, apart from private gains, may also require the existence of institutions that reduce the amount of conﬂict. One of such institutions can be a superior authority. Others can be family links between the agents that reduce conﬂict.

Proof to 4.4.2: From Lemma 4.1.1, in the main text, players that belong to the same coalition make the same appropriative effort and the same labor. Therefore, in a symmetric coalition structure every player make the same effort and obtain the same fraction of land. Then em = e and

Using equation (4.13), in the main text, the appropriative effort is

The individual labor supply is lm = l = 1 − e and the labor supply from one coalition is

Using equations (4.19), (4.20) and (4.21) in the utility expression the equation (4.9) is obtained.

Proof to proposition 4.3.1:

We want to show that Us > Ug when n ≥ 9 for any α with s = 1 and c = n − 1.

Claim A lower bound for the single deviator utility is

Proof.

From Lemma 4.4.1, es

From

equation (4.1) the fraction of land that the single deviator obtain is increasing with es. Therefore

From Lemma 4.4.1, es3 is the solution from the maximization problem (4.2). Hence Us >
