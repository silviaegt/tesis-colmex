Abstract Because soft drinks intake is considered a major contributor to the epidemic of obesity and overweight in Mexico, there has been a growing interest in evaluating the impact on consumption, and now on prices, of the recently enacted soft drink tax. This work uses information of weekly prices for a large set of soft drink products during the period 2013-2014 to exploit the natural experiment environment caused by this tax reform. The main objective is to evaluate the incidence of the soft drink tax, as well as deÔ¨Åne the market characteristics that determine this effect. Estimation results indicate over-shifting to Ô¨Ånal prices when considering the whole soft drink sample, however, they also report a variety of shifting patterns leaning on the individual product-type (soda, juice, sports drinks, powder-mix) market structure. I provide evidence of strong dependence between the shifting effect, the individual demand elasticity and the competitive barriers faced by retailers. Since many attempts in the empirical and theoretical literature have been made to characterize the effect of competition over the tax pass through, this work designs a detailed measure of the degree of competition faced by each establishment using information on store locations. Applying this measure it is shown that competitive barriers create signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the pass-through rate.

1 Introduction
The global obesity epidemic and its public health implications have been a worldwide concern in the last decades. Governments around the world have made considerable efforts to promote comprehensive policy packages against this condition, mainly by imposing excise taxes on high calorie foods. Arguably, such taxes should be able to improve social well-being by reducing consumption and rising new sources of revenue ( OECD (2013)).
An implicit assumption of the previous argument is that prices will rise as a response to the tax increase. However, economic theory shows that the burden of taxation depends crucially on market structure (Anderson et al. (2001) and Fullerton and Metcalf (2002)). In the long run, under perfect competition, homogeneous goods and constant marginal costs the pass-through effect of a tax increase is a one-to-one relation with prices. However, if Ô¨Årms hold some degree of market power and taxed goods are not perfectly homogeneous, price adjustments may vary differentially at a Ô¨Årm or at a brand level. Furthermore, establishment competition predicts that the ability of a single Ô¨Årm to set prices faints as the number of competitors increase within the relevant market, thus it is expected for diferent market conÔ¨Ågurations to present various tax shifting patterns (Hausman and Parker (2010) and Taylor et al. (2014)). This considerations imply that empirical work on tax incidence requires a more thorough analysis than the standard one.
In Mexico, the epidemic of overweight and obesity is remarkably alarming. OfÔ¨Åcial numbers show that 34.4% of the 5-11 years old children, 73% of women and 69.4% of men suffered of either overweight or obesity in 2012 (Barquera et al. (2010)) and accordingly to the OECD (2013), Mexico occupies the second place in obesity rates only after the United States. However, this epidemic is not more of an issue of public health than it is of public Ô¨Ånance. Consistent with the National Agreement for Nutritional Health of 2010, the sum of direct and indirect costs of obesity and overweight is expected to be 83 thousand millions of Mexican pesos in 2017. Hence, as part of a wide strategy to address this concern,1 in January 2014 the Federal government made effective a new tax on sugar-added beverages also known as soft drinks. The excise tax on soft drinks was set to one Mexican peso per-liter sold.2 Therefore, in

this work, a conÔ¨Ådential data set of prices is used to empirically assess the impact of an excise tax on prices and its relationship with competitive pressures across establishments.3
There is a long tradition in economics to analyze the pass-through of taxes (excise or ad-valorem) into consumer prices. Theoretically, Delipalla and Keen (1992) , Delipalla and O‚ÄôDonnell (2001) and more recently Weyl and Fabinger (2013) have built on the idea that the pass-through effect of a tax increase is so different under diverse market structures that one may be able to use it in order to characterize market power. They demonstrate that, in presence of imperfect competition, the incidence of ad-valorem and speciÔ¨Åc taxes may differ and each may be under or over-shifted into prices. The seminal papers by Poterba (1996) and Besley and Rosen (1998) show, empirically, that several shifting patterns are observed in real market conÔ¨Ågurations. The Ô¨Årst one uses city-speciÔ¨Åc clothing prices and Ô¨Ånds evidence of prices rising by approximately the amount of the sales tax for the post-war period in the U.S.. The second documents a variety of shifting patterns over very speciÔ¨Åc commodities in different U.S. cities using a panel of quarterly data.
Hence, the soft drink tax analysis presented in here is relevant for public policy and for empirical work in tax incidence for two main reasons. First, in Mexico, the latent health hazard posed by the epidemic of obesity and overweight is so strong that public intervention is essential. As stated for the Federal government, the purpose of the soft drink tax is to reduce consumption via price increasing, however, this may not be the observed result due to the Mexican soft drink and retail market structure. If the market is not perfectly competitive and taxed goods are not homogeneous (soda, juice, sports drinks and powder-mix) either, under or over-shifting may occur distorting the real objective of the tax and inÔ¨Çuencing unexpected results.
Second, the natural experiment environment caused by the exogenous price variation is explioded to evaluate the pricing behavior of retailer stores. This work uses product-speciÔ¨Åc (brand and presentation) data at the store level to compare prices in a weekly basis. Since the data set is sufÔ¨Åciently rich, it is possible to test a number of relevant hypothesis on tax incidence, such as the differentiated effect on product types, brands and presentations described by Besley and Rosen (1998), Poterba (1996) and Bergman and Hansen (2010). The stickiness of prices predicted by macroeconomic models and discussed in empirical work like the one

in Berardi et al. (2012), and Besley and Rosen (1998), and to consider the effect of competitive barriers on the pass-thorugh effect suggested by the empirical reaserch of Harding et al. (2012), Chiou and Muehlegger (2008), Alm et al. (2009) and Taylor et al. (2014).
This last consideration is of especial relevance as many attempts have been made to approximate the effect of competition on the results of Ô¨Åscal policy using aggregate measures, such as the density of competitors in rural or urban areas, the availability of lower-tax goods across state borders or the presence of potential entrants. In sharp contrast, this work designs a detailed measure of the degree of competition faced by each establishment using information on store locations. This is notably advantageous to test the hypothesis of pass-through under different market structures.
As implied above, the data set in this work is unique in nature and it is provided by the Federal Agency of Consumer Protection (PROFECO). By law, this agency collects establishmentspeciÔ¨Åc weekly prices for a large set products across the country in order to inform consumers about the date-to-date prices through an internet portal known as ‚Äú¬øQuie¬¥n es quie¬¥n en los precios?‚Äù (‚ÄúWho is who in prices?‚Äù). Most of the data collected relate to consumption goods, such as food, beverages, medicines and electronic appliances. Since only soft drinks prices and those establishments providing them are targeted in this work, the panel ensembled captures information of 607 stores around 27 cities in Mexico during the 2013-2014 period, this gives a total of over one million of weekly price observations. Therefore, leveraging the estimation on the rich panel structure available, it is possible to obtain clean identiÔ¨Åcation of the tax effect on retail prices controlling for a very substantial fraction of unobserved heterogeneity at store, brand and even product level.
Taking advantage of reduced-form price equations, Ô¨Åndings indicate over-shifting to Ô¨Ånal prices when considering the whole soft drink sample, however, they also report a variety of shifting patterns relient on the individual product-type (soda, juice, sports drinks, powdermix) market structure. Evidence of the strong dependence of the shifting effect on the individual demand elasticity and on the competitive barriers is provided. Also, accounting for the competitive pressures faced by each establishment it is shown that different market structures create signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the pass-through rate.
This work is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short review of the related literature and shortly recovers the economic theory behind tax incidence and its use as a tool for infer-
3

ring market power. Section 3 describes the data set and introduces some descriptive statistics on pricing behavior and the soft drink tax in Mexico. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and presents the models to be estimated. Section 5 discusses the results and the possible policy implications. Finally, section 6 concludes.
2 Background
This section dicusses some previous reaserch in the empirical evaluation of taxes, and reports the relevant theoretical constructs for this work.
2.1 Literature Review
In the past decades, it has been shown that there exist many other factors determining the incidence of taxation than theory traditionally considered, supply substitution and strategic interactions between retailers and producers are among the most widely analyzed. Recent theoretical work has paid especial attention on the consequences of market structure over the pass-through of a tax (Konrad et al. (2014), Reny et al. (2012), Fullerton and Metcalf (2002) and Delipalla and O‚ÄôDonnell (2001)). A fundamental implication of this literature is that, in an imperfectly competitive market, where Ô¨Årms interact strategically and have some control over prices, varying degrees of tax shifting are possible in both, the short and the long run. This consideration is just as important to policymakers as it is to academics since the result and consequences for public policy may directly depend on market structure.
As theoretical literature on tax incidence was growing to a better understanding of the matter, knowledge at the empirical level was also expanding rapidly. This line of work have focused on relaxing the often implicit assumptions of (i) homogeneous goods, (ii) full tax shifting and (iii) perfect competition, to evaluate the impact of several tax reforms mainly in the U.S. and Europe.
Cebula et al. (2014) relaxes the homogeneous good assumption to investigate the impact of cigarette excise taxes on the aggregate consumption, its Ô¨Åndings highlight the substitution of high for low nicotine cigarettes in the presence of a signiÔ¨Åcant cigarette tax hike in the U.S. market. Christian and Tianji (2011) also discards the assumption of homogeneous goods within the U.S. beer industry and, using brand-speciÔ¨Åc data of prices and quantity for
4

58 cities, Ô¨Ånds that the effect of a per-unit tax on sales may be different for low-quality brands than for high-quality brands. Besley and Rosen (1998) documents a variety of shifting patterns over very speciÔ¨Åc commodities as a response to the same tax hike in different U.S. cities over the 1982-1990 period.
As noted before, the inclusion of imperfect competition in the evaluation of tax incidence is of high relevance. Taylor et al. (2014) Ô¨Ånds full-shifting for gasoline and diesel taxes in Washington 2003, the competitive conditions are registered as the number of local rival stations as an aggregate measure. Alm et al. (2009) uses monthly gasoline prices over the period 1984-1999 to Ô¨Ånd that gasoline markets in rural areas exhibit full-shifting but those in urban areas demonstrate under-shifting, level of competition is approximated by assuming higher competition in urban areas. Harding et al. (2012) uses Nielsen Homescan microdata for 20062007 to demonstrate that taxes are less than fully passed through to consumer prices (one cent increase in taxes leads to a 0.85 cent increase in prices) approximating the level of competition by the availability of lower-tax goods across state borders. Chiou and Muehlegger (2008) use store-level scanner data from Chicago metropolitan area to estimate a cigarette tax pass-through rate of about 80% of the real increase, this work accounts for competitive barriers by suggesting that cigarette tax incidence varies with tax avoidance opportunities across state borders. Bonnet and Re¬¥quillart (2012) evaluates the impact on soft drinks consumption of simulated tax policies in France taking into account the strategic price response of both manufacturers and retailers, its Ô¨Åndings suggest that ignoring strategic pricing and competition among Ô¨Årms leads to underestimate the real impact of taxation by 15% to 40% depending on the product and the tax (speciÔ¨Åc or ad-valorem) implemented.
However, as far as my knowledge comes, none of these, or other related works, have built a thorough and speciÔ¨Åc measure of the degree of competition to study the role of market structure over Ô¨Åscal policy. Bearing in mind that the main object of the present investigation are the soft drinks, it is possible to think of them as highly differentiated products which notably differ from each other in terms of taste and quality. Furthermore, the soft drink industry in Mexico is highly concentrated, as is the retail industry. It is thus necessary to explicitly address imperfect competition in the chain to analyze how any changes in input costs are transmitted to the Ô¨Ånal consumers.
Regrettably there is still lack of empirical evidence regarding the impact of taxes in soft
5

drinks prices. Nonetheless, four recent works by Bonnet and Re¬¥quillart (2013), Berardi et al. (2012), Bergman and Hansen (2010) and Grogger (2015) are explicitly devoted to this matter.
Berardi et al. (2012) employs price records of non-alcoholic beverages to evaluate the impact on prices of the so called ‚Äúsoda tax‚Äù introduced in January of 2012 in France. Its Ô¨Åndings highlight two main results, the impact of the soda tax is different across retailing groups and beverage brands and the heterogeneous shifting pattern among different categories of soft drinks, the tax is fully shifted into soda prices while it is under-shifted in 40% of the ofÔ¨Åcial tax increase for juices and in 15% for Ô¨Çavored waters. Bonnet and Re¬¥quillart (2013), using a structural model and tax simulations, shows that an excise soft drink tax is likely to be overshifted 32% of the real increase to Ô¨Ånal prices in the French economy. Further, Bergman and Hansen (2010) exploits various excise tax shocks on alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage prices in Denmark, it comes to the conclusion that the two increases in the soft drink tax among 1998 and 2001 were over-shifted on more than 10% of the ofÔ¨Åcial tax increase for the 80% of analyzed stores. Finally, Grogger (2015) analyzes precisely the tax reform on soft drinks in Mexico, its Ô¨Åndings suggests an average 38% of over-shifting on sodas, however, no other category of soft drinks is considered.
The present work is closest in nature to that of Besley and Rosen (1998), Harding et al. (2012) and the one of Berardi et al. (2012). Although a more complete data set is employed, the estimation process cannot control directly for cost heterogeneity and other factors, as some of these investigations do since only price data is available. However robustness of the estimations is leveraged on the panel structure of the data using establishment-speciÔ¨Åc, time, product and brand Ô¨Åxed effects. Likewise, an structural approach as in Bonnet and Re¬¥quillart (2013) can not be implemented since quantity data is not available. Evidently, this precludes the conclusions for drawing inferences about market conduct. Nevertheless, our data varies greatly in different dimensions thus identiÔ¨Åcation of the tax effect on prices and the effect of the degree of competition on the pass-through effect is ensured.
Conclusively, it is worth to sum up the literature review as follows; Theoretical and empirical literature regarding the impact of excise taxes on prices in markets where imperfect competition prevails is unambiguous; in most cases the effect of the tax depends on factors that policy makers do not even consider when implementing Ô¨Åscal policy.

2.2 Economic Framework
Before going any further it is important to frame the economic foundations considered in the present analysis. In this context, two sources of prices variation are exploded in order to characterize the Mexican soft drink tax pass-through.
First, since the new tax on sugar added beverages speciÔ¨Åes one mexican peso per-liter sold, this sole increase can be thought as many tax raises function of product content, hiking an important amount of exogenous variation. Second, in antitrust literature, it is widely accepted that the smaller the relevant market, the bigger the market power of a single Ô¨Årm. Accordingly, it is expected to witness differences on pricing behavior depending on geographical market conÔ¨Åguration (Motta (2004)).
On the null hypothesis that retailer markets are competitive and in the long-run equilibrium with horizontal supply curves, it is expected to observe that all post-tax prices adjust to reÔ¨Çect a one-to-one relation, other things equal. Conforming with this perspective pre-tax prices in different geographical markets, with different degrees of competition, should reÔ¨Çect only differences in operation, locality-speciÔ¨Åc and season-speciÔ¨Åc costs. Conversely, if it is observed that post-tax prices differ by amounts that are greater or less than the associated taxes, it implies that the perfect competition hypothesis is inappropriate, and thus, the analysis of tax incidence must be modiÔ¨Åed accordingly.
Literature has shown that there exist more than one potential model available to conceive the relationship between tax incidence and prices under different market structures. The analysis presented in here is not structural, hence is not intended to appeal to any particular model. However, it is important to highlight that some theoretical structure underlies the econometric speciÔ¨Åcation presented in here.
Lets consider a n-establishment geographical market with asimetric costs of selling the good i at time t. In this setting, the establishment j chooses the variable xijt 4 to maximize its after-tax proÔ¨Åt function. Following Besley and Rosen (1998), it can be expressed as:

œÄijt = Rij (xijt, œÉit, Zijt) ‚àí Cij (xijt, œÉit)

(2.2.1)

Where Rij(xijt, œÉit, Zijt) is the total revenue function which depends on Zijt, a vector describ-

ing the behavior of other Ô¨Årms in the same market, the amount of speciÔ¨Åc tax (œÉit), and the

level of xijt. Cij(xijt, œÉit) is the total cost function. They both awre assumed to be constant

over time.

In the present context, it is widely accepted in empirical work that competition among su-

permarket chains and retail stores takes place by setting prices (Aguirregabiria and Vicentini

(2006), Seaton and Waterson (2013), GrifÔ¨Åth and Harmgart (2012), Cleary and Lopez (2011),

Chioveanu and Zhou (2013) and CastanÀú eda Sabido (2012)). Hence, a general form to describe

the optimal selection of price for the good i by the establishment j at time t , under Bertrand-

Nash competition is:

pijt = ¬µijt(mijt(œÉit))

(2.2.2)

Where the function ¬µijt captures the mark-up over the marginal cost of establishment j for selling the good i at time t. The marginal cost of selling one good, depends directly on the speciÔ¨Åc tax (mijt(œÉit)). Since the mark-up is a direct function of the tax œÉit, equation 2.2.2 can be reexpressed as:

pijt = fijt(œÉit, Œ≥ijt)

(2.2.3)

With Œ≥ijt, a vector containing all unobservable factors that affect the underlying cost of selling the good i and which may vary across time and location. It is useful to lay out a basic interpretation of the expected results using two extreme theoretical benchmarks presented in Figure 1.

Notes: Panel A shows a speciÔ¨Åc tax increase in a long-run competitive equilibrium with constant marginal cost and thus, an horizontal supply curve. Adjustments to the tax show full-shifting. Panel B depicts the same policy reform in a monopolistic equilibrium with a constant-elasticity demand curve. The graph shows that overshifting of the tax is more than possible. However, there exists the possibility for the demand curve to be differently shaped. In the case of an unitary elasticity of demand the speciÔ¨Åc tax hike is more likely to be under-shifted. A nice discussion of this matter can be found in Stiglitz (2003).

Under a perfectly competitive market conÔ¨Åguration, in the long-run equilibrium, supply

curve is horizontal and Ô¨Årms set prices equal to its marginal cost of selling, pijt = mijt. Hence

an speciÔ¨Åc tax is a one-to-one relationship with Ô¨Ånal prices pijt = mijt +œÉit. Nontheless, under

a monopolistic market conÔ¨Åguration the pass-through effect of the same tax is different and

highly depends on the shape of the demand curve.

Lets consider the general case of an isoelastic demand function. In this escenario, a mo-

nopolist maximize proÔ¨Åts by setting marginal costs equal to marginal revenue. Therefore,

they often charge a mark-up over marginal costs which can be evaluated using the Lerner

there is over-shifting.

Nevertheless, the market conÔ¨Åguration of supermarket and retail stores in Mexico do not

9

Iacovone et al. (2011), it can be characterized as an oligopolistic industry with few agents holding some degree of market power. In this regard, there is no theoretical consensus on which effect is more likely to occur, Anderson et al. (2001), Delipalla and Keen (1992), Harding et al. (2012), Reny et al. (2012) and Weyl and Fabinger (2013) have demonstrated that, in presence of imperfect competition, the incidence of an speciÔ¨Åc tax increase may differ from case to case and it can be either full, under or over-shifted into Ô¨Ånal prices. Yet, it is possible to anticipate from lines above that the elasticity of demand drives a large part of this effect.
To relate the econometric estimation of the pass-through with economic theory, the method in this work is to study the reduced form relationship expressed in equation 2.2.3 assuming that there exist unchanging establishment, product, brand and season-speciÔ¨Åc characteristics that affect pricing behavior of supermarkets and retail stores. The augmented equation is to be presented in section 4.
2.3 Policy Framework
Over the last few years, extending Ô¨Åscal policy to certain high-calorie foods have been increasingly seen as a practical response to obesity and obesity-related diseases. The concept of food and beverage taxes came into light within the Ô¨Årst decade of the new millennial, precisely when the worldwide obesity epidemic inspired calls for public policy interventions (Andreyeva et al. (2011), Brownell et al. (2009), Brownell and Frieden (2009), and Smith et al. (2010)). Consequently, governments around the world adopted some form of tax on highcalorie foods to lower levels of consumption.
Following the global scene, in late 2013 the Mexican Federal Government announced The National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Overweight, Obesity and Diabetes,5 in order to promote the prevention and control of obesity and related afÔ¨Çictions. The initiative consisted of three main pillars: health promotion, public healthcare investments and Ô¨Åscal policy.
In the latter category, in September 2013, Mexican president Enrique PenÀú a Nieto proposed a tax reform which included a special tax on sugary drinks. Amid criticism, nuance and lobbying from soft drink companies and conservative political parties, Congress approved the tax on soft drinks on October 18th 2013. Only one month later, in December of 2013 new amend-

ments to the Law on Special Tax on Production and Services (IEPS) were published.6 The modiÔ¨Åcations established a uniform tax rise of one-peso per-liter applicable on the sale or exchange of any Ô¨Çavored drinks, concentrates and powders if they contain any kind of added sugars.7 Finally, the policy reform became effective on January 1st 2014.

Mexico is not alone on taxing soft drinks since similar taxes already existed in some other countries, however, the Mexican tax remains conservative in magnitude its amount is equivalent to 0.12 USD PPP per-liter which is larger than the per-liter tax in France (0.08 USD PPP) but lower than the one in Denmark(0.21 USD PPP), Finland (0.23 USD PPP) and Berkeley CA. (0.33 USD PPP).8

3 Data and Descriptive Statistics
As suggested above, the method adopted in this work relies on the estimation of reduced
form price functions with the tax increase, competitive barriers and other exogenous deter-
minants of demand and cost conditions included as right-hand-side variables. Therefore, the
empirical counterpart of expression 2.2.3 requires data drawn from different sources.

7In the case of powders, the relevant tax is to be charged on the amount of sweetened beverage that can be prepared following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.

3.1 PROFECO Data
The Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) is the government institution responsible for ensuring fair consumer relations among economic agents. By law, one of its main activities consists in monitoring price setting behavior around the country. Thus, the agency collects prices of various goods through periodic visits to formally registered establishments. The price data employed here comes from this bureau.
The dataset provided for PROFECO is compiled following a precise methodology; each day of the week a trained PROFECO inspector visits a subset of establishments and stores in a particular and strategically deÔ¨Åned location . For each establishment, individual prices of various items, as shown on the shelves, are thoroughly registered.9 If an item is not available, no price is recorded.10
Since only soft drinks prices and those establishments providing them are targeted in this work, the assembled panel captures information of 607 stores around 27 cities in Mexico during the 2013-2014 period. Nonetheless, information of many other product prices such as milk, fruits, canned food and sugar itself can be linked to those speciÔ¨Åc establishments in order to assess the robustness of results. On the other hand, one disadvantage of the dataset is that missing values can arise due to data collection problems (e.g., product and establishments exclusion and inclusion over time, product unavailability on any speciÔ¨Åc week, etc.), nonetheless, this issue will be speciÔ¨Åcally addressed in section 4.
As described above, the information used in this work is unique in nature as it captures weekly prices for a large set of narrowly deÔ¨Åned soft drink products in four categories, soda, juices, sports drinks and powder-mix, includes information of 52 brands and an average of 3 presentations per brand of soda, 1 for juices, 1 for sports drinks and 2 for powdermix, giving a total of 75 unique products. The drinks sample is composed as shown in table 2.
9When there exist doubts about the price of an speciÔ¨Åc item, the inspector records the price scanned at the checkout. To avoid errors, every recorded price is veriÔ¨Åed at both the local and federal level.
10All information collected is compiled in a dataset known as ‚ÄúQuie¬¥n es quie¬¥n en los precios?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho is who in prices?‚Äù.

Notes: [a] In mexican pesos (mxn), for all products, presentations and years. [b] Not all products in this category contain added sugars, diet products are not taxed. [c] All products in this category contain added sugars. [d] Includes sparkling water and bottled water.

Approximately 80% of the drinks sample is subject to the tax increase, other products are kept as controls because their prices are highly correlated with those of taxed products.11 From Table 2 it is clear that the tax increase affects differently each product type. Considering each one of them as a basket of characteristics, the speciÔ¨Åc tax per-liter affects more directly products like powder-mix since its characteristics became relatively more expensive than those of products such as soda or sports drinks. When prices of two substitute goods, such as powder-mix and soda, are both increased by a Ô¨Åxed per-liter amount, consumption is expected to shift towards the less elastic product. This is true because the added per-liter amount decreases the relative price of the preferred product.
For further description of the dataset, the number of per-chain establishments is described in table 3.
11To reach this classiÔ¨Åcation, I examined the contents and nutritional information for every product in the sample. For some products, the so called ‚ÄúConsumers Magazine‚Äù, an ofÔ¨Åcial publication of PROFECO, is used to determine their taxability.

[b] Convenience stores include small retail stores that are open long hours and that typically sells staple groceries, snacks, and beverages like OXXO or 7-Eleven.

It is necessary to notice that given that most of the price observations in the sample are drawn from stores classiÔ¨Åed as supermarkets, this work is limited to observe the tax passthrough for this type of establishment. However, this matter does not limit the Ô¨Ånal conclusions.
Furthermore, the dataset provided by PROFECO varies greatly at the geographical level. This is advantageous to test the hypothesis of pass-through under different market structures. The information includes speciÔ¨Åc addresses for each establishment, however, in order to locate them in a reliable manner, individual coordinates were built using programming techniques and the beneÔ¨Åts of Google Maps.12 Results are reported in Ô¨Ågure 2.

Finally, although the sample is not constructed at random, its supermarket-chain conÔ¨Åguration is very close to that reported by the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores (ANTAD) to be the actual conÔ¨Åguration of the Mexican retailing industry, with six big chains competing among other smaller establishments.13 Moreover, the sample covers the major markets for the most representative cities over all geographic areas of the country, hence, representativeness is assured.
3.2 Mexican Store Universe
Since one of the main objectives of this work is to determine the inÔ¨Çuence of the level of competition on the pass-through effect of a tax, building a robust representation of the competitive universe that each one of the PROFECO stores face is essential. Therefore, I employed the National Statistics Directory of Economic Units (DENUE) for 2013 and 2014 provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), which includes identiÔ¨Åcation, location, economic activity, number of employees and asset size information for all economic

15

units formally registered in the country. Then the Industrial ClassiÔ¨Åcation System of North America (SCIAN) is employed to deÔ¨Åne the relevant store universe as follows:

After selecting only the relevant establishments from the universe of registered stores, the sample consists in 685,999 establishments located around the country as shown in the Ô¨Ågure 3.
Figure 3: DENUE 2013-2014 Stores

Source: National Statistics Directory of Economic Units (DENUE) for 2013 and 2014, INEGI.
An straightforward way to test the location map constructed for the PROFECO stores is to directly compare Ô¨Ågures 3 and 2. In fact, PROFECO stores are located at the exact same
16

location as the establishment clusters depicted by the coordinates from the store universe. A detailed map can be found in Appendix A.
3.3 Descriptive Facts
3.3.1 Degree of Competition This work uses three deÔ¨Ånitions of relevant market to study the level of competition faced by each establishment. Relevant market is deÔ¨Åned using Ô¨Åxed-radius circles of two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers around the establishments for which I possess price information, the PROFECO stores. This interpretation is widely used in competition analysis among supermarket and other stores mainly because it considers both, geographical distance and transport mode costs (See, for example, Hausman and Parker (2010), CastanÀú eda Sabido (2012), Beare and Szakiel (2009) and Ellickson and Grieco (2013)).
The economic intuition behind this deÔ¨Ånition is as follows; For most people the closest supermarket is the Ô¨Årst and most frequent option. If that one has unsatisfactory supply or too high prices the next establishment becomes the preferred option. The question then converts to how many extra kilometers or minutes one is willing to spend on passing by the closest supermarket and go to the next one? Thus, the competitive barriers of the Ô¨Årst-choice supermarkets are other establishments with traveling time not bigger than, I believe, 10 to 15 minutes for most of the consumers. Distances of two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers are deÔ¨Åned using this criterion.
Figure 4: Relevant market heterogeneity
Source: INEGI and PROFECO. Notes: Both panels show supermarket stores belonging to the same supermarket chain in the same State, city , time and less than 6 km. (crow-Ô¨Çy) away. Thus, the only difference between them both is the number of surrounding stores, high and low competition.
17

Figure 4 shows the existent heterogeneity between geographical location and the number of competing establishments that each supermarket faces within its relevant market. This differences represent the ideal variation needed to identify the pressure that competitive barriers pose on the price setting behavior. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the price adjustments after the exogenous variation caused by the tax increase.
However, there is absolutely no reason to believe that convenience stores or smaller grocery stores compete on the same intensity as supermarkets or warehouse clubs. Hence, in order to capture the degree of competition exerted over supermarkets by each kind of store I used the number of employees, provided by the DENUE database, to weight each individual inÔ¨Çuence. The methodology and descriptive tables are reported in Appendix A. Finally, I built the degree of Competition 14 faced by each establishment for two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers as the average number of establishments surrounding each of the PROFECO stores weighted by a factor that describes the level of competition it represents.
14The variable (Compi) is the standardized value of the degree of Competition.

Notes: [a] number of establishments weighted to compete in a one-to-one scale with supermarket stores (i.e., recall Ô¨Ågure 4, on the left panel, with high competition, the number of weighted establishments is 40.59 in a 2km-radius circle, on the right panel, with low competition, the number of establishments is 1 since only one other store -classiÔ¨Åed as a supermarket- is located within the relevant market). [b] grocery stores, convenience stores and warehouse clubs are excluded from the relevant market.
It is also relevant to notice that a time-dependent measurement of competition is more desirable than the static measurement proposed in here, nonetheless, the set of relevant establishments that opened between 2013-2014 and that fulÔ¨Åll the condition of being relevant for the PROFECO stores using the two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers market deÔ¨Ånition are so uncommon that it is possible to avoid this issue without bias in the estimates.
3.3.2 The Federal Excise Tax

Inspection of table 6 reveals that for virtually all cases of soda, the mean rates of tax passthrough are substantially over 1 peso, suggesting that soda taxes are more than fully passed through into prices. Surprisingly, presentations with less content in this category have an individual price, once converted to per-liter prices, much higher than larger presentations. This Ô¨Ånding helps to build some intuition about the tax shinfting effect, quite possibly, the smaller presentations are somehow different whitin the soda category.
Furthermore, mean per-liter prices for other soft drinks categories show different shifting patterns. On the one hand, juice and sport drinks prices entirely transferred the tax in early 2014, but decreased in the following month. And on the other powder-mix prices, which should be specially affected by the tax, did not increase at all, suggesting that the burden of the tax is fully bore by producers or retailers.

Per-liter price (mxn)

Note: Mean per-liter prices are computed from products with more than 1,700 observations per month. Prices in Mexican pesos.
Following the full mean per-liter price trend throughout 2013 and 2014, it is clear that 21

prices of the various categories of soft drinks behave differently. Soda prices show an aftertax stability, contrastingly, the process followed by products like juice and sports drinks, tell a different story. Astonishingly, the mean trend of prices show that most establishments decided to left unchanged the prices of powder-mix, even after the tax became effective.
The information obtained from table 6 and Ô¨Ågure 5 suggests that in order to characterize the effect of the tax increase over prices it is necessary to consider the unobserved heterogeneity between brands, presentations and product types.
4 Empirical Approach and Estimation
Have supermarkets passed the increase on the speciÔ¨Åc tax over the soft drinks in Mexico and to which extent? Are there any differences across taxed goods and/or retailing groups? To what extent the level of competition faced by each establishment determines the passthrough effect? This section aims to provide an econometric approach to solve these questions.
4.1 Pass-through Effect
Whenever we think on prices and its determinants it is important to bear in mind both, demand and supply side factors that affect pricing behavior. Prices may vary greatly due to differences in operating costs by store or location, by endemic differences between geographical markets, differences in purchasing power, population size and other socio-demographic variables. They may also vary as a function of supply-substitution, barriers to entry for new competitors, close product substitutes, in between others.
Although it is an almost impossible task to control for the complete set of this price determinants, it is assumed along this work that unobserved heterogeneity among establishments exists and that it is constant given the exogenous tax increase. Therefore, to take care of this constant characteristics at the establishment, brand and product levels, as well as changes in the macroeconomic environment that affect establishments the same way a Ô¨Åxed effects model is fully justiÔ¨Åed.
Accordingly, retaking equation 2.2.3 and leveraging the estimation on the panel structure of the data, the implementation of the Ô¨Åxed effects approach relies on the following model:
22

Model 1

Pijt = Œ®F E + Œ±1 ‚àó œÉit + uijt

(4.1.1)

With, Œ®F E = Œ∏E + Œ≥B + œÜT + œâMO + T xY M + œïP xT

Where the dependent variables Pijt are the individual prices of product i in the establishment j at the time t and œÉjt renders the product speciÔ¨Åc tax increase as described in section 2.3.
Œ∏E represents establishment-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects that capture differences between spatial and temporal costs affecting establishments in the same way. I assume the existence of constant and Ô¨Åxed characteristics that affect the costs of selling and thus, prices. (i.e. transport costs, rent tariffs, legislation, marginal cost, local wages and differences in the up-stream production chains are among the most used in the literature). Œ≥B and œÜT depict brand (Cocacola, Pepsi cola, Mundet, etc.) and product-type (soda, juices, powder-mix and sports drinks) unchanging characteristics respectively, they capture constant and particular heterogenity by brand and product-type that affect price setting (i.e. elasticity of demand and supply, quality, popularity, equity of the brand, seasonality, market niche and costs of raw material). œâMO represents month-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects and controls for those changes in the macroeconomic enviroment at affect all establishments in the same way (i.e. seasonal demand, income percapita, raw material prices, wages, etc.). T xY M (ProductXTime) Ô¨Åxed effects, control for the possibility of differentiated effect of product-type characteristics over time (year-month). Finally uijt is a withe noise error term.
From the perspective of tax incidence the key parameter is Œ±1, its value relates on whether the speciÔ¨Åc tax increase is under-, full- or over-shifted into prices. Usually, policy makers assume that Œ±1 = 1 so that tax-inclusive prices perfectly reÔ¨Çect any tax levied on every single good; the perfectly competitive prediction. However, a value of Œ±1 = 1 helps disprove the null hypothesis of perfectly competitive retailer market, as well as it helps to evaluate the result of the tax as a public policy. Thus, a tax increase designed to promote healthier food consumption and therefore improve public health might only be considered as effective if the policy is fully shifted into prices and if the market does not suffer signiÔ¨Åcant distortions.
The econometric speciÔ¨Åcation of model 1 is similar to that in Harding et al. (2012), Berardi

23

et al. (2012) and Besley and Rosen (1998), as it assumes constant heterogeneity affecting pricing behavior and adopts the Ô¨Åxed effects model as the most reliable approach. Yet, due to the richness of the available data, it is possible to improve this aproximation introducing more speciÔ¨Åc treatments such as Ô¨Åxed effects by establishment, by brand, and by product type. In like manner, Brownell et al. (2009), Allais et al. (2010), Bergman and Hansen (2010), Rojas (2008) are devoted to analyze, empirically, the impact of taxes over prices, however, most of these analyses have two main downfalls: First, they assume the lack of strategic pricing behavior, that is, producers, distributors and retailers are supposed not to adjust, strategically, product prices in response to the tax. Nonetheless, in the present context, Mexican soft drink industry is characterised by large retailer chains with different supply and distribution chains and few producers with some amount of market power, thus, it is essential to consider that each agent in the distribution chain charge an additional mark-up over the price of the product that will be Ô¨Ånally reÔ¨Çected into consumer prices.
Second, much of this literature is based on the estimation of structural models which requires the adoption of very restrictive assumptions, such as the functional form of costs or revenue. Additionally, the data demanded for this estimates is very costly since demand and supply side information is required. Therefore, many studies have used proxy variables to address the effect of factors determining pricing behavior. Still, the very nature of these variables is to provide an approximation, consequently the pass-through estimates may be biased.
Model 1 controls for strategic behavior at the processing, distribution and retailing levels by including establishment-speciÔ¨Åc, type of product and brand Ô¨Åxed effects that allow to capture strategic interactions at all levels of the distribution chain. Likewise, the establishment Ô¨Åxed effects enable to recover all the differences in the cost of sales and distribution that remain constant during the study period, solving completely the above limitations. The originality of this approach is to integrate the consideration of strategic pricing to obtain a causal effect of the tax increase on prices.
It is also worth notice that the implicit assumption of Œ±1 as independent of time, geographical location and product heterogeneity, is clearly very restrictive, as there is no justiÔ¨Åcation for the tax pass-through to be similar among this considerations or even constant over time. Nonetheless, I relax this assumption to assess the robustness of the results, furthermore, it is relaxed as a way for acquiring additional information on the pricing behavior
24

in the Mexican retail market, such as brand-speciÔ¨Åc or product-presentation pass-through effect.
4.2 Competitive Barriers Effect
Empirical literature on tax incidence concludes that there may be imperfect pass-through in prescence of less than perfectly competitive markets. (See, for example, Delipalla and O‚ÄôDonnell (2001), Rojas (2008), Katz and Rosen (1983), Hamilton (1999) and Nakamura and Zerom (2010)). The main explanation is the markup adjustment of manufacturers and retailers along the distribution chain, as well as the ability to Ô¨Åx prices by companies with market power in affected industries. Overall, this literature suggests that Ô¨Ånal prices are likely to be adjusted in response to a tax increase policy but not as the perfectly competitive scheme.
Although the relevance of market power is now widely accepted in the study of tax incidence, the issue has not been directly addressed, works like the one in Harding et al. (2012), Chiou and Muehlegger (2008), Alm et al. (2009) and Taylor et al. (2014) approximate the competitive conditions faced by Ô¨Årms using aggregate measures such as the density of competitors in rural or urban areas, the availability of lower-tax goods across state borders or the presence of potential entrants. Hence, in order to assess the speciÔ¨Åc relevance of competitive barriers on the pass-through effect, the following model is estimated:

Model 2

Pijt = Œ®F E + Œ±1 ‚àó œÉit + Œ¥1 ‚àó Compi + Œ¥2 ‚àó (œÉit ‚àó Compi) + Œ≤ijtZijt + uijt

(4.2.1)

With, Œ®F E = Œ≥B + œÜT + œÅBxT + œâMO + T xY M + œÖState + Œª(StateXY ear) + Œ∑Ch + œÄ(ChainXState)
Where the variable Compi measures the degree of competition faced by each establishment, its construction is explained thoroughly in section 3.3.1. Since the inclusion of establishment speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects takes down the variation needed to identify the effect of competition, they lost usefulness in this speciÔ¨Åcation. Hence, they are replaced by state-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects œÖState, an interaction of State and Year Ô¨Åxed effects Œª(StateXY ear), chain-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects Œ∑Ch, an interaction of State and chain Ô¨Åxed effects, œÄ(ChainXState), and a vector Zijt of covariates such as municipality population, per-capita income and economically ac-
25

tive population, to control for heterogeneity at state, municipality and chain levels. Following a Bertrand-Nash competition scheme, Œ¥1 and Œ¥2 are expected to be negative.
In a Bertrand model of oligopoly, Ô¨Årms independently choose prices in order to maximize proÔ¨Åts. The resulting equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in prices which is often referred as Bertrand-Paradox to describe that, even in concentrated markets, the effect of competition on strategic pricing behavior conduces Ô¨Årms to charge a price equal to their marginal cost. In real-world market conÔ¨Ågurations, retailers charge prices above marginal costs due to the existence of Ô¨Åxed costs, however, it is implied that, in presence of more competition within the relevant market, prices will converge to the marginal cost faster.
Of particular relevance is the coefÔ¨Åcient Œ¥2 from the interaction term tax-competition, adding this interaction expands greatly the understanding of the relationship between the pass-through effect and competition in the model and allows for more hypotheses to be tested. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the hypothesis that the relationship between the degree of competition in the relevant market on the pass-through effect is different depending, precisely, on the competitive barriers faced by each establishment.
In Model 2 with the interaction term (œÉit ‚àó Compi), the coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±1 represents the expected change on the price of good i in the establishment j at time t associated with one unit change in the level of the tax conditional on the degree of competition to be at zero (Compi = 0). As stated in section 3.3.1 the variable Compi is a standardized variable, therefore Œ±1 represents the mean effect of the tax when the degree of competition stands at its average level.
Œ¥2 from the interaction term, thus, express how much effect the degree of competition faced by each establishment has on the effect of the tax on prices. If the interaction coefÔ¨Åcient is negative, the effect of œÉit on prices decreases as the degree of competition increases, if positive the opposite. If the interaction coefÔ¨Åcient is zero, then the effect of the tax on prices is independent of the degree of competition.
4.3 Alternative SpeciÔ¨Åcations
So far two main issues have been addressed, Ô¨Årst the pass-through effect of the tax increases and second the effect competition over the price adjustment. Nonetheless, there exist other important issues yet to be taken care of. For instance, are there any differences across taxed
26

goods and/or retailing groups? how does the pass-through effect behaves over time? To address the Ô¨Årst question I relax the assumption of Œ±1 as independent of time and
product heterogeneity in Model 1. Slackening this assumption allows to examine for brandspeciÔ¨Åc, chain-speciÔ¨Åc and presentation-speciÔ¨Åc pass-through effect. Furthermore, since another important issue is the conduct of the over-shifting effect over time the following model is estimated.

(4.3.1)

and Jan2013, ..., N ov2013, Jan2014, ..., Dec2014 are dummy variables representing month and year, thus each interaction term gives information about the evolution of price adjustment to the tax over 2014. Since December2013 is excluded from the speciÔ¨Åcation, all coefÔ¨Åcients should be interpreted as relative to it. I do so for it is possible to clarify if supermarkets respond before the tax was effective, an anticipation effect before January 2014.

5 Results and Discussion
Given that the method in this work involves the estimation of several reduced-form price equations, the choice of speciÔ¨Åcation has been empirical. This means that I have searchced for the speciÔ¨Åcation which best Ô¨Åts and takes advantage of the unique data set available, subject to the properties assumed by the estimator being satisÔ¨Åed. The results are commented below.
5.1 Baseline pass-through results
I begin by discussing the estimates of model 1 in equation 4.1.1 and then analyze some alternative speciÔ¨Åcations to gather more evidence on the pass-through effect. To set up the analysis, I estimate the model using the full soft drink sample adopting different sets of Ô¨Åxed effects
27

to asses the robustness of the results. The same model is estimated by relaxing the product, geographical and chain-independence of Œ±1 to report differences in shifting patterns.15

Although it would be difÔ¨Åcult to specify all the economic, institutional, and demographic characteristics that determine price-setting behavior between establishments, it is possible to capture permanent heterogeneity affecting the costs of selling (i.e. transport costs, rent, legislation, local wages, differences in the up-stream production chains, etc.) using establishment speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects. In a similar way, if there exists any change in the macroeconomic environment that inÔ¨Çuence establishments all along, monthly Ô¨Åxed effects are able to capture those components. Moreover, given that in section 3.3 it was possible to gain some insight on the differentiated effects of the tax hike within the soft drinks set, it is important
15It is important to clarify that the dataset does not constitute a balanced panel of products. This may be a concern if, for example, the response to the tax increase from establishments is to substitute some expensive products for cheaper products or vice versa. This possibility should be captured by brand, product presentation and product-type Ô¨Åxed effects. However, I constructed a more balanced panel of products and obtain similar results so it was resolved to keep the largest dataset, results are reported in Appendix B.
28

to control for product-type unchanging characteristics , hence, product-type is considered in the primary set of Ô¨Åxed effects. All the above considerations deliver the estimate of column (1) in Table 7, reporting an over-shifting of 86% of the tax.
However, since the soft drinks set includes broadly deÔ¨Åned groups of brands it is fundamental to control for those unchanging characteristics at the brand level (quality, popularity, equity of the brand, seasonality, market niche, etc.) that may be inÔ¨Çuencing the tax passthrough in the same product but with different brand name (Coca-cola 355ml. and Pepsi 335ml.) thus, brand Ô¨Åxed effects are included in the estimate of column (2) which reports an over-shifting of 41% of the real tax hike.
Yet, there still exists the possibility for differences in the price setting behavior due to presentation-type constant characteristics. If these differences are ignored, then it is implicitly accepted that the determinants for the price of, for example, one liter of juice and one liter of soda are similar. I control for this possibility using an interaction Presentation-Type Ô¨Åxed effects, the estimation is reported on column (3).
Even further, the reaction of prices to the tax increase may include another component of the costs of selling so far neglected, the possibility for a differentiated effect of producttype characteristics over time. This kind of costs may vary greatly from time to time due to seasonal demand or seasonal raw material costs. Therefore, taking into consideration that different product types require different raw materials but also that they may be demanded differently by consumers, an interaction Product-Time Ô¨Åxed effects are implemented. Pooling together all the previous considerations, column (4) shows, I believe, the most reliable estimation of the pass-through effect, signaling an over-shifting of 30.1% above the real tax increase.
Result 1: There exists an over-shifting of 30.1% above the real tax increase considering the complete set of soft drinks prices in Mexico. This result is not consistent with the competitive paradigm, evidencing a concentrated Mexican supermarket industry.
As it is stressed in section 2, empirical and theorical work on tax incidence have demonstated that over-shifting is possible in a number of distinct market structures. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Delipalla and Keen (1992), Delipalla and O‚ÄôDonnell (2001) and Reny et al. (2012) show that, in a conjectural variations model with constant marginal costs for producers and a constant
29

price elasticity of demand different patterns of shifting, other than full-shifting, are very likely to take place. Then, in order to understand the resulting over-shifting, it is unavoidable to wonder if these assumptions hold for the Mexican supermarket industry. We know from section 3 that this industry is, in fact, highly concentrated with few dominant supermarket chains that could well be interacting strategically.
Additionally, since the time scope considered in this work covers a period of two years (2013-2014), it is reasonable to uphold that supermarket chains have not drastically changed their distribution channels and their business processes, keeping marginal costs constant. Furthermore, Castro and Carrillo (2014) and Barquera et al. (2008) show a relatively constant price elasticity of demand for soft drinks in Mexico from 2004 to 2012 so we can assume a similar turn for the years considered in here. Hence, the 31-cent over-shifting on soft drink prices is, by no means, a pathological or unexpected result.
Inasmuch as the hypothesis of a perfectly competitive supermarket industry has been disproved, it is possible for the after-tax prices of distinct soft drink products to react differently to the same tax increase as a function of the market structure. An straight forward way to gain some insights into the possible shifting patterns, is to recall the theoretical benchmark monopoly model highlighted in section 2. In this context, even if marginal costs are constant, the response to a speciÔ¨Åc tax increase highly depends on the elasticity of the demand.
In the soft drinks market there is no reason to believe that price elasticity of demand is constant among product types and consequently there is no grounds to presume that the price response is the same.16 To substantiate this argument I relax the product-type independence of the shifting parameter, the results are reported in table 8.
16Indeed, the literature suggests that the elasticities of demand of these commodities are rather different from each other. Castro and Carrillo (2014), Barquera et al. (2008) and Gil (2006).

[b] In cells (2)-(5), estimation is computed by product type, hence, product-type Ô¨Åxed effects are omitted and product presentation Ô¨Åxed effects are incorporated. [c] Cells in panel B include establishment, brand, product-type, monthly and product presentation Ô¨Åxed effects. Parameters are estimated using a combined sample of the individual product-type and water prices as a control (‚Äúdiff-in-diff ‚Äù parameter). [d] Panel C includes establishment, brand, product-type, monthly and product presentation Ô¨Åxed effects, It also includes the mean weekly water price as a covariate. [e] Panel D includes establishment, brand, product-type, monthly and product presentation Ô¨Åxed effects. Parmameters are estimated using a combined sample of the individual product-type, milk, sugar, citrics, eggs, coffe, corn tortilla and other goods as controls.

As startling as it might be, the different shifting patterns observed within the soft drinks set reveal an extreme heterogeneity of demand and supply for each product, and suggests that they should not even be considered as elements of the same market. In table 8, I set up the analysis running the standard model 1 by product type, however, being that estimation is computed by product category this speciÔ¨Åcation has an strong disadvantage as the shifting parameter is identiÔ¨Åed by comparing price variation within the same category between 2013 and 2014, a ‚Äúdifference‚Äù estimator.
An straight forward solution to this downfall is to include a relevant set of prices as a control, this set must fulÔ¨Åll the condition of having a similar trend to soft drink prices before the tax become effective and, as shortly described in the section 3, water prices meet this requirement. Thus, parameters in panel B are estimated using a combined sample of the individual product-type and water prices as a control in order to compute ‚Äúdiff-in-diff ‚Äù estimators.
To assess the robustness of results, yet two other speciÔ¨Åcations are tested. In panel C the mean weekly water price is included as a covariate. This speciÔ¨Åcation controls for timevarying shocks that affect establishments and soft drinks prices at the same time, the results are fairly similar. Furthermore, panel D also tries to recover ‚Äúdiff-in-diff‚Äù estimators, allowing for more products as controls, prices of, milk, sugar, citrics, eggs, coffee, corn tortilla and other regularly consumed products in Mexico are included in the sample, results are somehow identical from those in panel B suggesting that, indeed, the tax only affected soft drinks products.17
Result 2: The tax shifting patterns are uncommonly heterogeneous among types of products. Shifting goes from 0.39 mxn pesos of over-shifting on soda prices, to a 0.54, 0.28 and 1.00 mxn of under-shifting into juice, sports drinks and powder-mix prices respectivelly.
At the light of these results, a comprehensive way to understand the differences on shifting patterns may be to analyze each product individually and attempt to rationalize the Ô¨Åndings on the basis of various market structures. In order to present evidence of differentiated structures, the shifting behavior over time is analized using model 3 in equation 4.3.1, which gives information about the evolution of price adjustment before and after the tax was effective, thus it is possible to track the timing of supermarkets‚Äô response, the results are shown in
17If increases in soft drink prices around 2014 were caused by economy-wide price shocks, rather than the soda tax, then those price shocks should be observable in the prices of untaxed as well as taxable goods.

Note: In model 3, as December 2013 is omitted from the speciÔ¨Åcation, all coefÔ¨Åcients should be interpreted as relative to it. In this manner is possible to clarify any anticipation effect before January 2014.

The Ô¨Årst point to notice is that the results drawn from the available data set provide empirical evidence to the theoretical debate about the rigidity of prices facing exogenous cost shocks. In sharply contrast to the results presented in Bonnet and Re¬¥quillart (2013), which found a six-month period of price adjustments to a ‚Äúsoda tax‚Äù in France 2008, it is clear that the tax shifting takes place within the Ô¨Årst month of 2014 for all product categories. This result may be in the interest of the macroeconomists who often wonder about the existence of rigidities on prices. Ultimately, the empirical response at the Mexican soft drink market, is that prices react immediately and with no anticipation effect to cost shocks.
In the interest of this work is also worth to notice that from January 2014 on, each product type follows an independent path directly related with the market structure in which it belongs. For example, the stability of the over-shifting estimates for soda prices suggest that the
33

desired prices adjustments associated with the tax increase were completed by the end of the Ô¨Årst month and the over-shifting prevailed as the new equilibrium, this result is consistent with the oligopoly model described lines above.
Contrastingly, the processes followed by products like juice and sports drinks, tell a whole different story. It is true that the tax shiffting took place at the begining of 2014, however, the dynamics of the market lead to a fading effect. It is possible that Ô¨Ågure 6 depicts a lon-run convergence to the kind of equilibrium reached in the perfectly competitive model with an horizontal supply curve, sustaining a one-to-one relation between the tax increase and the prices. Astonishingly, results also show that most establishments decided to left unchanged the prices of powder-mix, even after the tax became effective. This practice has also been reported by Bergman and Hansen (2010) in the soft drinks market regarding a similar tax cut in Denmark 2003, its results show a mean under-shifting of 67% in a singel tax cut.
An important consideration is that, in Mexico, the price of fruit is relatively low compared with developed countries, they are so inexpensive that represent a real competitive barrier for some processed beverages. In this sense, products such as bottled juices and powdermix have much more competition within their relevant market than sodas or sports drinks which compete against products in the same category and bottled water. The difference in the number of close substitutes is also fundamental to understand the competitive pressures faced by retailers and the pass-through effect of the tax.
Result 3: Prices do not anticipate the tax rise. Moreover, different pricing behavior is observed among product types, soda prices respond immediately to the tax rise and stay high as a new equilibrium. Juices and sports drinks react differently, they increase as the tax became effective but cannot sustain the price rise, their prices decline in the following months but with a different intensity. Meanwhile, the powder-mix tax increase is fully borne by retailers.
Being even more thorough in the analysis if sodas, juices, powder-mix and sports drinks belong to the same market then it is expected for their prices to be strongly interrelated. In particular, it is expected a decline in the price of a product to be accompanied by declines in the price of substitute products, so that the relative price levels are maintained stable (Hofer et al. (2009)).
Clearly, a trend with strong and positive correlation between the price of soda and juice is
34

not observed in Ô¨Ågure 6, nor between soda and sports drinks. In the months following the tax increase, prices of juice and sports drinks behave contradictorily to soda prices, while the Ô¨Årst two go up the other one goes down and vice versa. Thus, by transitivity, prices for juice and sports drinks seem to follow a dynamic consistent with a higher degree of substitutability.
The price data available not only suggest that per-liter prices follow different dynamics but also that market structures are different among soft drinks categories. Then, the main argument to explain the different shifting patterns becomes the differences in precisely this structures, particularly, the competitive barriers and the elasticity of demand. Being that changes in competitive structures are associated with changes in the dispersion of market prices even for homogeneous goods,18 a natural indicator of the presence of a more or less concentrated market is the so called variation coefÔ¨Åcient which indicates the variation of prices across sellers of the same good keeping its characteristics Ô¨Åxed.
18Stigler (1961) noted that signiÔ¨Åcant price dispersion is typical of natural markets even for perfectly homogeneous goods in local geographic markets, so a lack of dispersion indicates some degree of market concentration. Abrantes et al. (2006) examines price movements after the collapse of a big collusion in the retail gasoline industry, it Ô¨Ånds that a low price variation is an strong indicator of collusion. Bolotova et al. (2008) compares the differences in the price setting during collusive and competitive phases of two public conspiracies in the Unites States. According to its results, the variance of prices during the conspiracy is dramatiacally lower than during more competitive periods.

Interpretation of Ô¨Ågure 13 is straight forward, the higher the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation the greater the heterogeneity of prices, which is related to a more competitive market structure. The results are overwhelming, perhaps, the most striking is the trend followed by the distribution of soda prices, it maintains a descendant trajectory in the pre-tax period, meaning a constant reduction in the price-setting heterogeneity among establishments, this drop stops only in the after-tax period and maintains its level for 2014. This Ô¨Åndings are consistent with a highly concentrated market where some Ô¨Årms agree to set prices at some level to accommodate the tax increase. Meanwhile, prices of juices and sports drinks follow a different path. After the tax is imposed, the former increases the variation in price setting, presumably due to a stronger competitive reaction from retailers, the latter follows a similar trend but the over-all reaction is more conservative.
Another difference in market structure that may be driving the heterogeneity in shifting patterns is the elasticity of demand. If the elasticity plays an important role determining the tax shifting, then it is expected to witness differences in the consumption level after the tax
36

increase and that these settings play the counterpart of the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation. Unfortunately, detailed information about soft drink consumption by category is scarce
and does not allow to test this hypothesis formally. However, it is reasonable to assume that the monthly production of soft drinks is, for the most part, intended for regular consumption (i.e production is not stored), then an approximation for consumption may be the total monthly production by category.

In Ô¨Ågure 8, the total of thousands of liters (tons in the case of powders) produced in 2014 is compared with the total production on the same month for 2013 (the same for years 20122013). The results reinforce the argument of different market structures as the reaction of production is different among categories. It is important to notice, in the Ô¨Årst place, that the overall impact of the tax is not as expected for the authorities, at least as far as production is concerned, the total amount of soft drinks produced did not decline after the tax was imposed

37

and rather seems to have increased.19 Similarly, production of soda for 2014 does not decrease compared with its 2013 levels,
even though the average price for one liter increase in more than 1 mexican peso (overshifting), this image allows to suggest that the demand for soda is highly inelastic. On the other hand, the drastic decline in juice production in early 2014 depicts a very price-sensitive demand. However, the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation also illustrates an increased price competition for the after-tax period, the effect of competition vanished the tax price-increasing effect and forced retailers to maintain less than a one-to-one relationship between the tax and prices. I believe that this constitutes fairly compelling evidence that the shifting results presented in here are being served by different market structures for each product.
Result 4: Shifting patterns depend on the market structure in which each product is located, particularly, on the elasticity of demand and the competitive barriers faced by retailers. Evidence shows that the level of shifting is lower the higher the elasticity of demand in each market.
Being even more speciÔ¨Åc, Castro and Carrillo (2014) suggests that the elasticity of demand within product type follows a positive relation with the product content in the Mexican market, implying that the more the product content the less the elasticity of its demand. To test this hypothesis I estimate model 1 for an only-soda sample allowing for the coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±1 to vary according to the product presentation.
19In fact, Calvillo et al. (2015) reports that in the after-tax period, many soft drink companies intensiÔ¨Åed their propaganda and advertising campaigns which may be driving the increased production.

Results reported in table and Ô¨Ågure 9 are somehow consistent with the elasticity approach so far considered. They signal that the less elastic presentations are those of family-size and the commonly consumed canned soda, indicating a pattern of signiÔ¨Åcant consumption in Mexican households. This outcome should not be very surprising since in table 6 it is reported that the per-liter soda price, under any brand, is much higher for smaller presentations than their larger counterparts, this phenomenon and the differentiated shifting patterns add evidence on the different market structures among presentations and product content within the same product type.
To gather more information on the pass-through effect of the soft drink tax, I also consider
39

model 1 and relax various assumptions on the shifting parameter such as brand, chain and geographical independence. Results are highly consistent with different market structures on any of this considerations. Two issues should be highlighted: First, bigger and more rooted brands in Mexico, with a presumably less elastic demand and greater market power such as Coca-cola (coke) or Pepsi over shift a bigger amount of the tax (0.61 and 0.80 Mexican pesos respectively), while the over-shifting is much lower for brands with less market power as Jarritos or Mundet (0.20 and 0.19 respectively). Second, shifting patterns also vary greatly from chain to chain and in concordance with the market power approach, results suggest that chains with higher market power over shift a large amount of the tax, for example Wal-Mart and Bodega Aurrera with 0.51 and 0.53 Mexican pesos respectively, meanwhile chains like ISSSTE, a government store, over shifts a lower amount, 0.15 mexican pesos. All this evidence embodies the hypothesis that the tax incidence of a speciÔ¨Åc tax depends largely on market structure of the taxed good.20
5.2 Competitive Barriers
In order to assemble a thorough analysis on tax incidence, it is fundamental to analyze, the inÔ¨Çuence of market structure on price setting behavior and the extent on which this institutional structure inÔ¨Çuence the expected results. As mentioned in section 2, this concern has been handled in the literature under different treatments.
Taylor et al. (2014) Ô¨Ånds full-shifting for gasoline taxes aproximating competitive conditions as the number of local rival stations. Alm et al. (2009) uses gasoline prices to Ô¨Ånd that gasoline markets in rural areas exhibit full-shifting, but those in urban areas demonstrate under-shifting. Harding et al. (2012) Ô¨Ånds under-shifting of various tax hikes approximating the level of competition by assuming that the availability of lower-tax goods across state borders creates signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the passthrough rate. Chiou and Muehlegger (2008) approximates competitive barriers showing that cigarette tax incidence varies with tax avoidance opportunities across state borders.
However, none of these or other related works have built an speciÔ¨Åc measure of the degree of competition to examine the role of market structure over Ô¨Åscal policy. Thereby, as detailed in sections 3 and 4 three deÔ¨Ånitions of relevant market are adopted in here to study the level
20Detailed estimates can be consulted in Appendix B.
40

of competition faced by each establishment in this work. Using Ô¨Åxed-radius circles of two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers, the degree of competition is deÔ¨Åned as the number of surrounding stores for each of the 607 establishments for which I possess price information. Then, the relevance of competition on the pass-through effect is estimated using model 2 in equation 4.2.1 and results are reported in Table 10.

To identify the inÔ¨Çuence of competition over the pass-through effect of a tax hike is not an easy task, to obtain a clean identiÔ¨Åcation it is fundamental to control for all the factors that potentially affect price setting behavior among chains, municipalities and even establishments. I take advantage of the rich panel data available and estimate a Ô¨Åxed effects model that allows to isolate the effect of competition taking into consideration constant heterogeneity between establishments. The results are reported in columns (1)-(3) for the three measures of relevant market considered in here.
41

Recall from section 4 that the coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±1 represents the average expected change on the price of good i in the establishment j at time t associated with one unit change in the level of the tax conditional on the degree of competition to be at zero (Compi = 0). Since the variable Compi is standardized, then Œ±1 represents the mean effect of the tax increase when the degree of competition stands at its average level. Œ¥2, thus, express how much effect the degree of competition faced by each establishment has on the effect of the tax rise on prices. Given that the interaction coefÔ¨Åcient is negative in all cases, the effect of œÉit on prices decreases as the degree of competition increases, giving empirical support to the hypothesis that the higher the level of competition the less the over-shifting of tax into prices.
The interpretation of the magnitude of the effect should be constructed relative to the measures of central tendency for the variable Compi, recall from section 3 table 5, in a 2 kilometer radius, the average number of supermarkets (as the number of different stores have been weighted) surrounding the stores for which price information is available is 21 and a positive alteration of one standar deviation constitutes an increase of 9 establishments within the circular area of 12.56 square kilometers.21 Thus, the interpretation of the parameter Œ¥2 is as follows: the average pass-through of the tax hike, considering a 2km relevant market, is 0.31mxn where the degree of competition is at zero (i.e in geographical markets with 21 supermarkets within the 12.5km relevant area), if we move towards a geographical market with 30 supermarkets in the relevant market, it is expected a reduction on the over-shifting of 9.1%.22 The same is true for other distances.
Since, the inclusion of establishment-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åxed effects takes down the variation needed to identify the individual effect of the degree of competition over prices, model 2 is also estimated using a different set of Ô¨Åxed effects and several demand- and supply-side factors to control for heterogeneity at state, municipality and even at store level. However, as columns (4)-(6) in table 10 suggest, it is difÔ¨Åcult to capture all the relevant price determinants. Indeed, estimates of the pass-through effect in columns (4)-(6) do not differ substantially from those
21The average number of establishments within each one of the relevant markets is potentially high, this is because of PROFECO uses a methodology that gives priority to speciÔ¨Åc and strategic locations in some major cities, presumably with a large number of stores. However, the data also accounts for large amounts of variation which can be perceived in the minimum-maximum range. A detailed semiparametric representation of the distribution of the variable Compi is presented in Appendix C.
22For example, recall Ô¨Ågure 4 in section 3, this is a graphical representation of two supermarket stores belonging to the same supermarket chain in the same municipality at the same period of time (less than 6 crow-Ô¨Çy km. away), the only difference between these two is, precisely, the number of surrounding competitive stores. Then it is expected, for the over-shifting to be relatively lower for the most inhibited establishment.
42

presented in (1)-(3). Nonetheless, the signs obtained for the competition variable are inconsistent with the theoretical expectation. In any case, this effect is very close to zero for all distances.
Even more, I believe that this should not be considered as a dramatic outcome because, as stressed before, there are many other unobserved factors affecting pricing behavior that may be driving up the results. Moreover, the signs and magnitudes estimated for the interaction term, report a direct and negative effect of competition over the pass-through effect closely related of those reported in (1)-(3).23
A further interesting matter is whether it is adequate to assume that the average and negative effect of competition is constant over all degrees of competition. To test this hypothesis, model 1 is estimated by sort of degree of competition for the relevant market of 2km and 5km, the shifting parameters estimated are plotted in Ô¨Ågure 10.
23It is also worth noticing that the coefÔ¨Åcients for the three relevant markets provide empirical evidence for the validity of the deÔ¨Ånition of relevant market used in this work, as in both speciÔ¨Åcations the negative effect of competition over the pass-through grows importantly from the 2km to the 5km relevant market, but stays still for the bigger distance, 8km. Thus, validating the intuition that consumers are only willing to spend a (10-15)minutes drive to substitute a supermarket.

Figure 10 and 11 work in two directions. First, using a semiparametric approach, it illustrates that the effect of competition is not constant over the scale of competition, since the mean of the variable competition is zero, it is very clear that its effect is higher for those establishments located in a geographical market below the average (for 2km less than 21 supermarkets and for 5km less than 91 supermarkets) than for those operating in markets with a greater number of competitors. Additionally, it seems that ther e exists a limit for the negative pressure imposed by the competition on the pass-through, the restrictive effect faints for those establishments that are located in highly competitive markets. Second, the slope of the Ô¨Åtted line validates the estimates of Œ¥2 presented in table 10, the -0.12 for 2km and the -0.13 for 5km are easily spoted.
In order to understand the resulting estimates in the clearest possible way, it is needed to frame them within some economic intuition, then, the economic construct behind this results, I believe, is that in the standard Bertrand competition model. Given that it is accepted

44

that supermarkets compete by setting prices, a given Ô¨Årms best response to a price increase of a competitor is to also increase prices. A tax increase can be thought of as a price increase by one Ô¨Årm that causes subsequent price increases of other Ô¨Årms. Thus, the Ô¨Årst order effect of a tax rise is that Ô¨Årms increase their own prices because of the higher cost imposed by the tax, furthermore, this effect is magniÔ¨Åed because establishments are reacting to the higher observed price from competitors (resulting in over-shifting of the tax to prices). However, this trend faints rapidly as the number of competitors and other competitive barriers increase within the relevant market. A single deviation from the higher price, and since supermarkets often sell the same product range (homogeneous goods), causes a rapidly drop in prices that only stops when the new marginal cost of selling the good is met, causing the desired fullshifting.
Result 5: The number of stores in the relevant market has signiÔ¨Åcant effects on the pricing behavior of retailers. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the degree of competition faced by establishments determines the shifting effect of a tax hike. Results show that, the effect of increasing the number of supermarkets from 21 to 30 within a circle of radius 2km reduces the mean over-shifting (0.31mxn) in 9.1% and increasing the number of supermarkets from 91 to 140 within a circle of radius 5km reduces the mean over-shifting in 9.8%.
A major criticism about the extent of the level of competition considered so far is that, perhaps, supermarkets do not consider smaller stores as direct competition and therfore do not take part in supermarkets‚Äô price setting process. To test this hypothesis, a variation of the variable Compi is drawn considering only supermarkets and similar stores within the circles of 2km, 5km and 8km radius. Results are reported in in table 11.

Recall from table 5 that the number of supermarkets and mini-markets within the relevant market is relatively smaller than the full measure of competition, therefore, results in table 11 reveal an interesting result.
Result 6: Supermarkets are not only concerned about peer stores within their relevant markets. Other establishments such as grocery stores, convenience stores and warehouse clubs take part on their price setting decision.
Furthermore, following the competitive barriers notion used to analyze the pass-through effect, a valid intuition is whether supermarkets react differently depending on the product type and the competitive barriers faced. Given that it has been established that the elasticity of demand drives a huge effect on price setting behavior, a differentiated effect of competition over pass-through among different product types would indicate that the elasticity of supply is also a highly related factor.

Results in Table 12 reinforce the Ô¨Åndings of previous section, in fact, heterogenity on demand elasticities among different product types lead much of the tax pass-through. However, the joint consideration of the level of competition and the effect of competitive barriers is key to fully understand the effect of a tax increase as a public policy.

6 Conclusion
The effectiveness of employing soft drink taxation, as a tool for controlling consumption and combating obesity problems is not yet well documented, even less the effect of competitive institutions over the expected effect of taxation. However, from a public health perspective, the success of such intervention relies primarily on the pass-through from retailers to consumers in the form of increased prices. The Ô¨Åndings in this work demonstrate that, across soft drinks categories and market settings, a tax increase have different shifting patterns and thus, is not clear who bears the burden of the tax.
Mexico imposed a nationwide one-peso per-liter tax on sugary drinks, effective January 2014, in order to combat the growing obesity problem and other public health concerns by increasing the Ô¨Ånal consumer prices. Thus, using a rich dataset of weekly prices for 75 unique soft drink products across 607 stores around the country, I evaluate the incidence of the Mexican soft drink tax, controlling for a large amount of constant heterogeneity across establishments, product types, product presentation and brands.
Findings show strong and consistent evidence of a 31% over-shifting of the tax into prices. However, they also prompt that the over-shifting is entirely driven by sodas with a shifting of 1.39 Mexican pesos into per-liter prices, since any other product category such as juices, sports drinks and powder-mix disclosed under-shifting into their Ô¨Ånal prices (0.46, 0.71 and 0.00 respectively). Such shifting patterns are consistent with different market structures going from oligopolized markets, such as Mexicos soda market with no close substitutes, to more competitive arrangements such as the juices market, sports drinks and powder-mix.
Along this work it is also found evidence supporting that that the effects of the tax in 2014 were reÔ¨Çected almost immediately into Ô¨Ånal prices and that there was any anticipation effect from establishments. This provides empirical proof on the theoretical debate about the rigidity of prices facing exogenous cost shocks. Furthermore, market structure (supply and demand conditions and competitive barriers), in which every category of soft drinks is considered, drove the long run effect of the tax. From January 2014 on, each product type follows an independent path. The stability of the over-shifting estimates for soda prices suggest that the desired prices adjustments associated with the tax increase was completed by the end of the Ô¨Årst month and the over-shifting prevailed as the new equilibrium. Contrastingly, the
48

processes followed by products like juice and sports drinks imply the tax shifting took place at the beginning of 2014, but the dynamics of each individual market lead to a fading effect. Surprisingly, results show that most establishments decided to leave unchanged the prices of powder-mix, even after the tax became effective.
In this work, I also intended to bring forward a relevant discussion in the empirical competition literature, the effect of local competition and spatial information on pricing behavior and, explicitly, the effect of relevant competition over Ô¨Åscal policy such as excise taxes. In order to capture the existent heterogeneity between geographical location and the number of competing establishments that each supermarket faces within its relevant market I designed a through measure of the degree of competition. Results highlight that the number of stores within the relevant market of a single store has signiÔ¨Åcant effects on its pricing behavior. Even more, the degree of competition faced by establishments determines the shifting effect of a tax hike.
Evaluation and design of Ô¨Åscal policy are typically generated under the assumption that commodity taxes are fully shifted and with no further consideration of any other market structure. The estimates in this work show that these simpliÔ¨Åcations do not always have empirical validity. Policy implications of the results presented in here are striking, as distributional and effectiveness considerations for proposed policy interventions are thus, typically biased. If, in fact, prices on some commodities go up more or less than on a one-to-one relationship, then taxes on these items are more or less burdensome than the usual analyses would suggest.

II. Degree of competition (Compi)
In order to design a comprehensive measure of the degree of competition faced by each establishment for which I possess information, an standard technique of the empirical supermarket competition literature is adopted. Using programming techniques and the computational power of geographic information system programs (GIS), I was able to recover the exact number of relevant establishments surrounding the PROFECO stores within Ô¨Åxedradius circles of two, Ô¨Åve and eight kilometers. After calculations were made, each one of the sorrounding establishments was classiÔ¨Åed according to the number of employees reported in the DENUE 2013-2014.

Then, the variable Compi is deÔ¨Åned as the weighted average of the number of establishments that surround each of the PROFECO stores. Finally, to simplify the interpretation of results the variable is standardized.
