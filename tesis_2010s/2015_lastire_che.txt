Abstract In this thesis we estimate several speciﬁcations of the New Keynesian Phillips (NKPC) curve for six Latin American countries using the technique of the Generalized Method of Moments. The analysis is conducted using two alternative approaches that introduce open economy considerations into the aggregate supply-side of the economy. In addition, we include lagged inﬂation as an explanatory variable to study its importance. Our main ﬁndings are that the backward-looking inﬂation is an important determinant in understanding the dynamics of inﬂation for the Latin American countries in our sample. In addition, we found statistical evidence suggesting that the open economy versions of the NKPC ﬁt better the data for the economies of Chile and Mexico.

1 Introduction
The analysis of what determines inﬂation and its short-run behavior is one of the most important questions in macroeconomics. For many years the main tool to understand the inﬂationary process was the Phillips curve. In its moder form, the Phillips curve1 relates inﬂation to some cyclical indicator (such as the unemployment rate, the output gap, etc.) plus lagged values of inﬂation. However, one of the main problems of the Phillips curve is that is subject to the Lucas critique. That is, the stability of this equation across policy regimes is unclear, since the coeﬃcients of the Phillips curve also change with shifts in economic policy (Gali et al., 2001). Consequently, as argued by Galí et al. (2001), structural modeling of inﬂation is desirable, which gave birth to the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC).
It is important to stress that there are at least three important diﬀerences between the traditional version of the Phillips Curve and the NKPC. First, in the NKPC real marginal cost is the main driving force inﬂation. Second, the NKPC is the result of a well-deﬁned optimization problem for monopolistically competitive ﬁrms. Third, the NKPC implies that the process of inﬂation is forward looking, with current inﬂation a function of expected inﬂation.
There now exists a vast literature with the empirical estimation of the NKPC, considering diﬀerent assumptions associated with various versions of time-dependent price-setting2 in a closed economy framework, based on the framework of Taylor (1980) or Calvo (1983) (for further details see Ólafsson (2006)). In this thesis, we are going to focus on a literature that estimates the NKPC, based on the Calvo (1983) price-setting approach, using GMM estimation. However, empirically there are diﬃculties to reconcile the NKPC with the data. First, since real marginal cost is a non-observable variable, the early literature, like Fuhrer and Moore (1995), used the output gap as a proxy. The reason being that in the absence of rigidities in the labor market, the output gap proportionally varies with real marginal cost (Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997). However, empirically studies typically estimated a negative sign for the output gap coeﬃcient. Second, since current inﬂation is a function of expected inﬂation in the NKPC, it has no intrinsic inertia in inﬂation. This characteristic has been questioned empirically. For example, Fuhrer and Moore (1995) ﬁnd that the baseline NKPC leads to a poor empirical ﬁt and performs better with an amended speciﬁcation
1By the Phillips curve in its modern form, following Rudd and Whelan (2007), we refer to the FriedmanPhelps expectations augmented Phillips curve.
2The time dependent price setting assumes that ﬁrms change their prices on an exogenous way that is unaﬀected by the state of the economy (Ólafsson, 2006).

that includes the lag of inﬂation (known as hybrid version of the NKPC).
Consequently, in order to overcome these failures, some elements have been added to the standard NKPC in order to improve the empirical results. Galí and Gertler (1999) introduce three main changes. First, they develop a model of inﬂation that allows for a fraction of ﬁrms to use a backward-looking rule to set prices, in order that lagged inﬂation inertia enters into the NKPC. Second, instead of using the output gap as a proxy for real marginal cost, labor income share is used as a proxy. Finally, they used the technique of the GMM to estimate the parameters of the NKPC for the U.S. for the period 1960:Q1 to 1997:Q4. Their main ﬁndings were that the labor income share is positive and signiﬁcant, and thus, the use of this variable provides a good description of U.S. inﬂation dynamics. Additionally, Galí and Gertler (1999) found that the coeﬃcient for expected inﬂation, which takes values between 0.59 and 0.87, dominates the coeﬃcient associated with lag inﬂation (estimated values are between 0.085 and 0.383). This suggests that the inﬂation dynamics of the U.S. can be reasonably explained using a pure forward-looking version of the NKPC using the labor share as a proxy of real marginal cost.
Following the methodology of Galí and Gertler (1999), a number of other studies have empirical tested the NKPC for other countries. Galí, Gertler and López-Salido (2001) show evidence for the Euro area for the period 1970-1998. In this article, the authors compare the characteristics of European inﬂation dynamics with the inﬂation dynamics of the U.S. They concluded that the NKPC seems to ﬁt the inﬂation for the Euro are in an acceptable way, and similar to Galí and Gertler (1999), the forward-looking component is estimated to be higher than the backward-looking component. Some other studies for developed countries like Scheufele (2008) for Germany and Masaiko (2009) for Japan found results in line with those of Galí and Gertler (1999). However, despite its apparent empirical success, this representation of the NKPC has been subject to criticism, especially by Rudd and Whelan (2007). First, they criticize the use of the labor share as a proxy for marginal cost, since theoretically real marginal cost and output should be procyclical. Thus, if labor share is a good proxy of real marginal cost, the labor share and output should be also procyclical. However, the empirical evidence for U.S. displays a countercyclical pattern. Second, they prove that the use of instrumental variables that are not part of the model such as the interest rate and commodity price inﬂation, could bias the estimates for the forward-looking component of the NKPC, and thus, this method will tend to yield a small coeﬃcient on lagged inﬂation (Rudd and Whelan, 2007). However, despite these criticisms, the Galí and Gertler (1999) framework remains the dominant approach in the empirical literature.
2

A recent strand of the literature has focused on extending the NKPC framework to an open-economy setting. Examples of this are Batini, Jackson and Nickell (2005) which estimate an open economy version of the NKPC using UK data. They modify the baseline NKPC model by introducing the relative prices of imported inputs and foreign competition pressures in the marginal cost function. They ﬁnd that these open economy components to be signiﬁcant. A similar study by Balakrishnan and López Salido (2002), also for the UK, ﬁnd similar results. Rumler (2005) estimates an open-economy NKPC for 9 Euro Area countries by decomposing the real marginal cost into three diﬀerent factors of production (real unit labor costs and the price of imported and domestically produced intermediate goods). His results suggest that the degree of structural price rigidity is higher in the open economy case because "the fact that when ﬁrms face more variable input costs as they import from volatile international markets they tend to adjust their prices more frequently" (Rumler, 2005). Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011), consider a sample of ten OECD countries, and estimate a NKPC using a modiﬁed version of the popular small open economy model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) whereby the NKPC now includes changes in the terms of trade. Their main results show that for many of the sample countries the terms of trade can be considered as a more relevant variable than the output gap, suggesting that external factors are more important in explaining inﬂation dynamics than internal factors (output gap). Holmberg (2006) also considers the case of an open economy NKPC for Sweden. She proceeds in a similar way to Rumbler (2005) and decomposes real marginal cost into two components: the labor share and the imports of intermediate goods. In this case, however, her results cannot pin down a statistical relationship between the coeﬃcient of the imports of intermediate goods and current inﬂation.
In respect to the literature related with Latin American countries, for Chile, Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005), following the procedure of Galí and Gertler (1999), estimate the NKPC for the period 1990-2004. Their main ﬁndings are that, unlike studies for developed economies, the backward-looking component of the Hybrid NKPC is actually an important variable explaining inﬂation dynamics. For Mexico, Ramos-Francia and Torres (2006) estimate a closed economy version of the NKPC for the period 1992-2006. Their ﬁndings are in line with those of Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005), in the sense that the backward-looking component has a stronger weight compared to the results of Galí and Gertler (1999). These studies indicate important diﬀerences in the inﬂationary process of Latin American countries compared to industrialized economies.
3

In this thesis, I estimate the NKPC for a set of Latin American countries using quarterly data. I estimate the parameters of the model using GMM, the standard econometric technique of the literature. Because Latin American countries have increased the degree of openness during the last two decades, I consider two open economy speciﬁcations of the NKPC. One version is based on the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) which was employed by Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011). The second version follows the model of Holmberg (2006). In addition, in both frameworks the importance of lagged inﬂation is also considered.
The main ﬁndings of the thesis are as follows. First, it was not possible to ﬁnd strong statistical evidence between the variables used as proxies for the real marginal cost(i.e., the output gap and the unit labor cost) for all the countries in the sample. However, in the case of Peru, the output gap was found to be an important variable in explaining the inﬂationary process of this economy. Second, the pure forward-looking model was rejected by the data, since the results for all estimations show that the backward-looking component is high and signiﬁcant for all the Latin American countries in the sample, which is consistent with the two previous studies mentioned for Latin American countries. Third, the results suggest that the open economy speciﬁcations of the NKPC describe in a better way the inﬂationary process for Mexico and Chile.
The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows. Section 2, outlines the empirical facts for the behavior of inﬂation in Latin American countries over the sample period. In Section 3, I present the two theoretical frameworks used to derive the NKPCs used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 discusses the data and Section 5 describes the GMM technique which is used to estimate the parameters of each model. The results are reported in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes.

2 Motivation
Explaining the evolution of aggregate prices and inﬂation is one of the most important topics in empirical macroeconomics, and in recent years the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) has become a popular tool to analyze the dynamics of inﬂation. While there exists a number of empirical studies which estimate the NKPC for developed countries as discussed in the introduction, empirical evidence for developing countries is scarce. However, Latin American countries exhibit several characteristics which make them a particularly interesting case to study.
One interesting characteristic of several Latin American countries relates to the evolution of inﬂation over the last four decades. A number of Latin American economies experienced high and volatile inﬂation during the 1980’s. According to Corbo and Schmidt-Hebel (2001), in many cases this high inﬂation was due to ﬁscal dominance (i.e. monetary policy was primarily dictated by ﬁscal ﬁnancing needs). However, starting in the early 1990’s the region implemented signiﬁcant ﬁscal and monetary reforms, the eﬀect of which has resulted in a substantial decrease in inﬂation rates throughout Latin America. Today, price stabilization has been achieved in the region under various monetary and exchange rate regimes, ranging from exchange-rate-based stabilization and dollarization, to inﬂation targeting in combination with ﬂoating exchange rates (Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2001).
In order to properly analyze inﬂation dynamics, it is important to focus not only on its level, but also on its volatility. According to Broto (2008), volatile inﬂation is costly as it causes more uncertainty about future levels of inﬂation. Higher uncertainty about future inﬂation can result in lower credibility of the monetary authority, which in turn, may lead to more persistent inﬂation (Céspedes et al., 2005)3. In Table 1, I present the mean and the standard deviation (as a measure of volatility) of the inﬂation rates for the sample of Latin American countries that I am going to consider in this thesis: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. For comparison, I also include estimates for the U.S., Canada and the Euro area. The inﬂation rate is measured as the quarterly percentage change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
3Inﬂation persistence refers to the impact of past inﬂation on current inﬂation.

Notes: For Latin American countries all the data comes from the Central Bank of each country. For U.S., Canada and the Euro Area the data comes from OECD. ∗ The period sample for Canada is 1992-2014. ∗∗ The period sample for the Euro Area is 1995-2014. ∗∗∗ n.a. means that there is no data available for Canada and the Euro Area for this period.

For the period 1980-2014, Table 1 clearly shows decreasing levels of inﬂation and inﬂation volatility for all the Latin American countries of interest. For example, in the case of Mexico a substantial reduction is observed, considering that the average quarterly inﬂation went from 13.74% in the decade of the 1980’s to 1.14% in the period 2000-2014, which represents a remarkable reduction of 1105%, approximately. In respect to volatility, the percentage reduction is similar, since went from 8.35 in the decade of the 1980’s to 0.71 for the period 2000-2014, representing an approximate percentage change of 1076%. However, large historical diﬀerences exist between inﬂation levels experienced in Latin American countries and many developed economies, where inﬂation dynamics have been much more stable. For example, comparing the inﬂation rates between Chile, the country with the most stable inﬂation rate in Latin America, and the U.S., is observed that the average quarterly inﬂation rate has been higher for Chile over the sample, being 4 times larger during the 1980’s, 3.5 times higher in the 1990s and 1.5 times in the period 2000-2014. Additionally, it must be noted that these statistics also show that has been a trend toward similarities in the inﬂation rate for these countries.

Table 1 also shows that signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist in the inﬂation rates and inﬂation volatility of the diﬀerent Latin American countries of interest. In general terms, the region can be divided into two groups: one group consists of Chile, Colombia and Mexico, where quarterly inﬂation levels have remained below double digits (with the exception of Mexico in

6

the 1980’s), and a second group comprised of Argentina, Brazil and Peru, where for much of the sample period (with the exception of 2000-2014) quarterly inﬂation has been in double digits.
A second interesting characteristic of many Latin American countries is the sizeable increase in trade openness that has taken place in recent years throughout the region. Since the end of the 1980’s a number of countries have abandoned protectionism and introduced market-oriented reforms to open-up their economies. Figure 1 depicts the degree of trade openness for each economy of interest over the period 1980-2013, measured as the ratio of the sum of imported and exported goods and services as a share of gross domestic product. While Figure 1 highlights the growing trend of Latin American countries to increase economic openness, there are signiﬁcant levels of heterogeneity between countries. Table 2, calculates the mean of the degree of trade openness for the period 1980-2013. By inspection, countries such as Mexico and Chile have experienced a much higher degree of trade openness than Brazil and Argentina, for example.

Notes: Author calculations using data from the World Bank.
While higher degrees of trade openness could have aﬀected the inﬂation dynamics of each economy via several alternative channels, in this thesis I focus solely on two: the imports of intermediate and capital goods used in the production function, and the terms of trade. Given the heterogeneity found in the data, we would expect that these two channels play a more important role in the inﬂation dynamics of relatively open economies like Chile and Mexico compared to the relatively closed economies of Brazil or Argentina.

3 Theoretical Framework
3.1 Models description
This section presents a brief summary of the theoretical New Keynesian models used to derive the diﬀerent versions of the NKPC which we wish to estimate. For the ﬁrst approach, I follow Galí and Monacelli (2005) who construct a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model of the world economy by assuming a continuum of small open economies. As I will show, the supply side of a small economy in this model is represented by the NKPC. The second approach is based on the work of Holmberg (2006) who extends the supply side of Galí and Monacelli (2005) to allow for the eﬀects of international price developments on the inﬂation rate. She introduces a component which measures the importance of imported goods into the marginal cost function of ﬁrms. In addition, Holmberg (2006) derives a hybrid version of the NKPC, which allows the model to capture the impact of inﬂation inertia.

8

3.1.1 Approach 1: The Galí and Monacelli (2005) Model

Technology and Marginal Cost of Firms Galí and Monacelli (2005) assume that

ﬁrms in each country produce a diﬀerentiated good with linear technology represented by

the production function4

Yt(j) = Nt(j)

(3.1)

where Nt(j) is the labor force used by ﬁrm j. Given the production function in equation (3.1) the nominal total costs of the ﬁrm, T Cn, will be given by

T Cn = WtNt(j) = WtYt

where the nominal marginal cost M Cn of ﬁrm j is

M Ctn(j) = Wt

In what follows all lower-case letters denote log-deviaions from steady state values. Consequently, the log-linearized expression for real marginal cost (expressed in terms of domestic prices), which is common across domestic ﬁrms, is given by:

mct = wt − pH,t where pH,t is the log-deviation of the domestic price index.

(3.2)

Firm maximization problem and Calvo price setting behavior In order to derive
an expression for aggregate inﬂation in this model, it is necessary to derive the price setting
behavior of ﬁrms. Galí and Monacelli (2005) assume that ﬁrms set prices according to
Calvo (1983), where each ﬁrm can only changes prices infrequently. The frequency of price
reoptimization is a stochastic process with a constant probability that a ﬁrm sets its prices
in an optimal way at each point in time. Thus, each period a measure 1 − θ of randomly selected ﬁrms reset their prices, while a fraction θ keep their prices unchanged. Let P¯H,t denote the price set by a ﬁrm j in period t 5. A ﬁrm who reoptimizes in period t will choose the price P¯H,t that maximizes current market value of the proﬁts generated while that price remains eﬀective. Then, in this context, the representative ﬁrm´s maximization problem is
4In this case, I am using a simpliﬁed version of the production function used by Galí and Monacelli (2005), since I set At, the economy wide technology level, equal to one.
5Since all ﬁrms resetting prices in any given period will choose the same price, the j can be dropped, and then we can take a representative ﬁrm only.

where β is the time discount factor, Qt,t+k = βk(Ct+k/Ct)−σ(Pt/Pt+k) is the stochastic discount factor derived from the optimality condition for the intertemporal problem (the election

between present and future consumption) of the household in the economy that we are con-

sidering and M Ctn+k is the nominal marginal cost. The ﬁrms maximization problem given in (3.3) is subject to its demand function. In this case, given that we are considering an open

economy model, the demand for domestic good j is the sum of demand from the small open

economy and the world economy. Hence, the demand constraint will be

6It can be noted that when the ﬂexible price case is considered, i.e., θ = 0, (3.7) simpliﬁes to:

(3.8)

P¯H,t = − 1 M Ctn
. This equation implies that under ﬂexible prices ﬁrms set an optimal price that is constant mark-up over their marginal cost.

11

where p¯H,t denotes the log of newly set domestic prices in period t and mctn+k is the log-deviation of nominal marginal costs around the steady state. It can be seen that the pricing decision in equation (3.11) is forward-looking. The reason for this is that ﬁrms that are able to adjust their prices at any given period recognize that the price they set remains unaltered for a random number of periods. As a result, the price they set is a mark-up over a weighted average of expected future marginal costs, instead of just contemporaneous marginal cost only.

Derivation of the NKPC We now derive the NKPC for this open economy. In order to do
this, we need to consider the dynamics of the domestic price index, which under Calvo (1983) price setting will be a weighted average of a share (1 − θ) of ﬁrms which are able to reoptimize in that period and a share θ of ﬁrms who cannot change price. Thus, the structure of the domestic price index is described by the following equation:

1 PH,t = θPH1−,tε−1 + (1 − θ)(P¯H,t)1−ε 1 − ε

(3.9)

The log-linearized version of equation (3.9) around the zero inﬂation steady state is

pH,t = θpH,t−1 + (1 − θ)p¯H,t

(3.10)

In order to derive the NKPC, I ﬁrst use the log-linearized version of the price setting rule of the ﬁrms (equation (3.8)) and forward it by one period:

∞
p¯H,t+1 = (1 − βθ) (βθ)kEt+1 mctn+k+1
k=0

(3.11)

Taking expectations, using the the law of iterated expectations and multiplying by βθ yields:

∞
(βθ)Et {p¯H,t+1} = (1 − βθ) (βθ)k+1Et+1 mcnt+k+1
k=0

(3.12)

Substracting (3.11) from (3.12) and multiplying by (1 − θ) I get:

(1 − θ)p¯H,t = (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)mcnt + βθEt {(1 − θ)p¯H,t+1}

(3.13)

From the log-linearized equation of the domestic price index (equation (3.10)), I can substitute out (1 − θ)p¯H,t and (1 − θ)p¯H,t+1 (after iterating one period forward):
=⇒ pH,t − θpH,t−1 = (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)mctn + βθEt {pH,t+1 − θpH,t}

12

Using the fact that the log of the nominal marginal cost can be expressed as mcnt = mct + pH,t, where mct ≡ mct − mc is the log deviation of real marginal cost from its steady state value7, and
after some algebra I obtain

=⇒ θ(pH,t − pH,t−1) = (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)mct + βθEt {pH,t+1 − pH,t}
Finally, from the deﬁnition of domestic inﬂation, πH,t = pH,t −pH,t−1, I arrive at the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) for this model:

πH,t = λmct + βEtπH,t+1

(3.14)

where

(1 − θ)(1 − βθ)

λ=

>0

θ

Equation (3.14) represents the domestic inﬂation rate as the sum of two components: the discounted

expected inﬂation and the real marginal cost, with λ being the real marginal cost elasticity of

inﬂation. From equation (3.14), it can be observed what are the main diﬀerences between the

traditional Phillips curve and the NKPC. As discussed in the introduction two main diﬀerences can

be identiﬁed. First, in the NKPC the real marginal cost is the main driving variable for the inﬂation

process. Second, the NKPC implies that the inﬂation process is forward looking, which means that

current inﬂation is a function of expected future inﬂation.

In what respect to λ, it must be noted that it is a decreasing function of θ, the parameter that

measures the degree of rigidity in the economy. According to Walsh (2010), the reason of this is

that an increase of price rigidity (i.e. an increased of θ) reduces λ because with opportunities to

adjust arriving less frequently, the ﬁrm put less weight on current marginal cost when adjust its

price. In addition, an increase of β, implies that ﬁrms gives more weight to future expected proﬁts.

Consumer Price Index and Terms of Trade Because we are considering an small
open economy, the domestic price index and the consumer price index (CPI) are of course diﬀerent. In the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005), the CPI index Pt can be deﬁned as a combination of the domestic price index PH,t and the price index of imported goods PF,t for the home economy:

1
Pt = (1 − α)(PH,t)1−η + α (PF,t)1−η 1−η

(3.15)

where η > 0 measures the substitutability between domestic and foreign goods, from the point of view of the domestic consumer and α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter that measures the degree of openness in the economy. The closer α is to one, the more open is the economy. When α = 0, we have the case of a closed economy and thus the CPI and the domestic price index are equal. The log-linearized
7The steady state value of the real marginal cost is mc = −log ε ≡ −µ. ε−1

13

version of the CPI around a symmetric steady state satisfying the purchasing parity condition,

PH,t = PF,t under assumed full producer currency pricing yields (see Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler

(2011) for details)

pt ≡ (1 − α)pH,t + αpF,t

(3.16)

Another important concept in an open economy framework is the terms of trade. In this model,

the eﬀective terms of trade are deﬁned as the price of foreign goods in terms of home goods and are

represented by

St

=

PF,t PH,t

(3.17)

where the log-linearized version of equation (3.17) is given by

st = pF,t − pH,t

(3.18)

Using the above, it is easy to show that CPI inﬂation, πt = pt − pt−1, is determined by domestic price inﬂation and ﬂuctuations in the terms of trade. First, by using the log-linearized version of the terms of trade, where we solve for pF,t:

pF,t = st − pH,t

(3.19)

to substitute out pF,t from the log-linearized version of the CPI (equation (3.16)) and taking diﬀerences yields:
=⇒ pt = pH,t + αst

πt = πH,t + α∆st

(3.20)

Now iterate the above equation forward one period and taking expectations yields:

Etπt+1 = EtπH,t+1 + α∆Etst+1

(3.21)

and using (3.20) and (3.21) to substitute out πH,t and EtπH,t+1 from (3.14) the following expression for the NKPC is obtained:

πt = βEtπt+1 + λmct + α(∆st − βEtst+1)

(3.22)

In addition, Galí and Monacelli (2005) shown that in their model the output gap and real marginal cost are proportional, thus, the NKPC is also represented as

πt = βEtπt+1 + καyˆt + α(∆st − βEtst+1)

(3.23)

where yˆ represents the output gap. Equation (3.22) (or (3.23)) shows that for open economies the CPI inﬂation rate is not only driven by current-period real marginal cost (or output gap) in

14

addition to expected next-period CPI inﬂation, as in closed economy, but also by the expected changes in terms of trade. The intuition behind the introduction of the terms of trade in the NKPC is as follows. As pointed out by Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011), an expected improvement in the terms of trade (∆st > βEt∆st+1) would increase current demand for domestic goods (as their price is relatively lower than what is expected in the future) and this increase in demand generates upward pressure on current inﬂation. Note that if α = 0, in equations (3.22) and (3.23) we once again revert to the closed-economy version of the NKPC.

3.1.2 Approach 2: The Holmberg (2006) model

Holmberg (2006) also assumes that ﬁrm price-setting follows Calvo (1983). Consequently, the optimal price set by ﬁrm i is:

∞
pit = (1 − βθ) (βθ)kEt mcnit+k
k=0

(3.24)

which is identical to equation (3.8). To introduce inﬂation persistence into the theoretical framework, Holmberg (2006) follows the Galí and Gertler (1999) and allows for some backwardness to capture the inertia in inﬂation. Speciﬁcally, it is assumed that a share (1−θ) of ﬁrms are able to adjust their price, while the remaining ﬁrms keep prices ﬁxed. However, of the ﬁrms who are allowed to change their prices, only a fraction (1 − φ) can now set prices optimally (i.e. in a forward looking manner), while a fraction φ use a simple rule of thumb that is based on the recent history of aggregate price behavior. Galí and Gertler (1999) deﬁne these ﬁrms as backward-looking ﬁrms. Consequently, the index for newly set prices can be expressed in log-linearized form as:

p∗t = (1 − φ)p¯ft + φptb

(3.25)

where the superscript f indicates the price of ﬁrms that set prices optimally and the superscript b indicates the price of backward looking ﬁrms. All forward-looking ﬁrms will choose the same optimal price and behave exactly as in equation (3.8)

∞
p¯tf = (1 − βθ) (βθ)kEt mctn+k
k=0

(3.26)

The assumed rule-of-thumb for the backward looking ﬁrms can be expressed in log-linearized form as follows8 is, in log-linearized form, as follows:

pbt = p∗t−1 + πt−1

(3.27)

8Galí and Gertler (1999) assume that the rule of thumb has two features: (a) there is no persistent deviations between the rule and optimal behaviour, i.e., in the steady state the rule is consistent with optimal behavior; (b) the price in period t given by the rule depends only in information dated t-1 or earlier.

15

where p∗t−1 is the price index reset in period t − 1 and πt−1 = pt−1 − pt−2. To derive the NKPC we proceed as follows. First, the aggregate price level in log-linearized form evolves according to

pt = (1 − θ)pt∗ + θpt−1

(3.28)

Second, subtract (3.28) from (3.27) to get

ptb

− pt

=

1 1 − θ [πt−1] − πt

(3.29)

Third, solving for p∗t in (3.28) and plugging the result into equation (3.25) yields

From (3.29) we can substitute ptb+1 − pt+1 in equation (2.31) to get

Et

θ + φ(1 − θ)

φ

= (1 − φ)(1 − θ) Et {πt+1} − (1 − φ)(1 − θ) πt + Et {pt+1}

(3.32)

Fourth, quasi-diﬀerentiating (3.26) yields:

ptf = (1 − βθ)mct + βθEt ptf+1

(3.33)

which expressed with the log deviation of the real marginal cost becomes:

ptf = (1 − βθ)[mcrt + pt] + βθEt ptf+1

(3.34)

If we subtract pt from both sides of equation (3.34) pft − pt = (1 − βθ)mctr − βθpt + βθEt ptf+1

(3.35)

and substituting (3.32) into (3.35) generates

pft − pt = (1 − βθ)mctr + βθ + βθ

θ + φ(1 − θ) (1 − θ)(1 − φ)

βθφ Et {πt+1} − (1 − θ)(1 − φ) πt

(3.36)

Finally, substituting (3.36) and (3.29) into (3.30) the hybrid NKPC its obtained

or in a compact version

(3.38)

where

(1 − βθ)(1 − θ)(1 − φ) ξ=
θ + φ[1 − θ(1 − β)]

βθ λf = θ + φ[1 − θ(1 − β)]

φ λb = θ + φ[1 − θ(1 − β)]

By inspection of equation (3.38) we see that in the case of φ = 0, i.e., the number of backward-

(1 − θ)(1 − βθ)

looking ﬁrms is zero, ξ =

θ

; λf = β, and λb = 0, and then, (3.38) collapses to the

baseline representation of the NKPC.

Real Marginal Cost speciﬁcation In order to capture the eﬀects of international price

changes, Holmberg (2006) assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function which not only depends on

national inputs, but also on imported inputs. The assumption here is that all ﬁrms adopt the same

production function technology and need three inputs, labor (N), capital (K) and imported goods

(IM). In addition, let At denotes technology. Thus, the production function of any ﬁrm in period t

is:

Yt = AtNtζ (IMtδKt1−δ)1−ζ

(3.39)

where 0 < ζ < 1, 0 < δ < 1. Note that this production function implies constant return to scale with respect to production factors. To get the cost function, it is necessary to solve the following cost minimization problem (assuming that capital is ﬁxed, where for simplicity I set At=Kt=1)

min(WtNt + PtmIMt)

(3.40)

s.t. Ntζ IMtδ(1−ζ) = Yt
where Wt is the nominal wage of the workers, Nt is the labor that ﬁrms want to hire, Ptm is the price of imported inputs and IMt represents the imports of the intermediate inputs. Solving this minimization problem we get the following cost function:

Then, the marginal cost function, which is obtained from the ﬁrst order condition for Yt is given by

After dividing by Pt (the aggregate price level), we get an expression for real marginal cost:

(3.44)

where the two components of real marginal cost can be deﬁned as lst = (wt + nt − pt − yt), which is real unit labor costs and imst = (pmt + imt − pt − yt) is the share of imported intermediate goods to production in current prices.

NKPC for an open economy Now, I have all the elements to express the NKPC in the
second model as one that takes into account the international environment via the marginal cost of ﬁrms. Using equations (3.38) and (3.44), the NKPC can be expressed as

πt = κ1lst + κ2imst + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1

(3.45)

where:

lst

=

wtnt ; ptyt

imst

=

ptmit ; ptyt

ζ κ1 = ξ ζ + δ(1 − ζ)

δ(1 − ζ) κ2 = ξ ζ + δ(1 − ζ)

This representation of the NKPC tell us that current inﬂation will be driven not only by the expected

inﬂation and the unit labor cost, but also by the share of imported inputs into the economy which

has a positive impact on inﬂation (since the parameter κ2 is positive) and by the lag of inﬂation, which is a measure of inﬂation inertia. As in the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005), a closed

economy representation can be obtained when the share of imported inputs it is equal to zero.

3.2 Summarizing
Before proceeding, let’s summarize the equations that I am going to empirically estimate. As usual in the literature, I am going to estimate each speciﬁcation using both, the unit labor cost and the output gap as proxies for marginal cost. Thus, I will specify equations using both variables. As a benchmark, I will ﬁrst estimate a closed economy version of the NKPC. From equations (3.22) and

18

(3.23) of the Galí and Monacelli (2005) model, by setting α = 0 I get

πt = λmct + βEtπt+1 πt = κyt + βEtπt+1

(3.46)

By setting the share of imported inputs equal to zero in the hybrid closed-economy version of the NKPC derived from Holmberg (2006) yields

πt = ξmct + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1 πt = κyt + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1

(3.47)

After the estimation of the representations above, I am then going to consider the open economy versions of the NKPC. Thus, from the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) I have the equations

πt = βEtπt+1 + λmct + α(∆st − βEtst+1) πt = βEtπt+1 + κyt + α(∆st − βEtst+1) (3.48)

In order to be able to compare both models, I will also consider the special case of the model

of Holmberg (2006) when φ, the number of backwardness ﬁrms is equal to zero. This gives the

expressions

πt = Ω1lst + Ω2imst + βEtπt+1 πt = Ω1yˆt + Ω2imst + βEtπt+1

(3.49)

(1 − βθ)(1 − θ)

ζ

(1 − βθ)(1 − θ)

δ(1 − ζ)

where Ω1 =

θ

ζ + δ(1 − ζ) and Ω2 =

θ

. ζ + δ(1 − ζ)

Finally, I am going to consider the case of a hybrid open economy. Even though for the case of the

model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) I have not fully derived a hybrid version of the NKPC, it will

be worthwhile to estimate a representation of this model with the lag of the inﬂation as explanatory

variable. This yields

πt = Υf Etπt+1 + Υbπt−1 + λmct + α(∆st − βEtst+1) πt = Υf Etπt+1 + Υbπt−1 + λyt + α(∆st − βEtst+1) (3.50)
where Υf and Υb the coeﬃcients associated with forward and backward looking component of inﬂation. The equivalent derived from the model of Holmberg (2006) is given by

πt = κ1lst + κ2imst + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1 πt = κ1lst + κ2yt + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1 (3.51)

4 Data Description
I estimate the equations above for six Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Table 3 summarizes the sample period for each country which diﬀers due to data availability.

Notes: ∗ For the case of Argentina, the unit labor cost only cover the period 2001-2013.∗∗ For the case of Peru, I do not have data of the unit labor cost.
All the data have been obtained from the Central Bank and/or the National Institute of Statistics of each country. In the appendix I detail the source of each variable for each country.For each speciﬁcation of the NKPC, the inﬂation rate is expressed as the quarterly percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Figure 2 shows the evolution of the CPI inﬂation rate for each country. It is important to note that there are some important facts that explain the behavior of inﬂation during the period that I am considering. For the case of Argentina, the shaded area in the graphic represents the period of the currency board scheme (the Convertibility Regime), which was adopted in April 1991 as an attempt to anchor inﬂation expectations by ﬁxing the peso to the dollar. This policy, combined with public sector reforms which included the privatization of the main public enterprises and the dollarization of the ﬁnancial system was succesful in anchoring inﬂation expectations (D´Amato et al., 2008). By 1993 inﬂation in Argentina had stabilized at low levels. However, in 2001 a combination of external and ﬁnancial crises (which was caused in part by the Asian crisis and some internal ﬁscal disequilibrium), led to the abandonment of the Convertibility regime, to a sharp devaluation of the currency and to the adoption of a managed ﬂoat. The devaluation of the currency provoked a jump in the inﬂation rate, which reached a peak in April 2002. After the crisis, the inﬂation rate returned to lower levels, but still higher than those of the convertibility regime. For the case of the other countries, one important change happened during the 1990’s: all of them adopted the Inﬂation Targeting (IT) monetary regime. For the case of Brazil, before IT, a pegged exchange rate regime had been adopted from 1994 to 1999, to help stop the country´s hyperinﬂation crisis. This regime was successful in reducing the inﬂation rate during those ﬁve years, but it turned out to be unsustainable in the medium run, since according to Barbosa (2008), this stabilization strategy was heavily dependent on the inﬂow of foreign capital and, as a result, the international ﬁnancial position of Brazil became fragile after the contagion eﬀects of the East Asian currency crises

20

of 1997 and the Russian currency crisis of 1998. This resulted in the adoption of a ﬂoating exchange regime in 1999 and the introduction of an explicit inﬂation targeting framework in the same year, which ended a period when the exchange rate had been the main anchor for monetary policy. In Figure 2, I illustrate with a vertical line the date when Brazil adopted the IT regime, which by inspection, has maintained inﬂation at a low level, with the exception of a spike in 20029. Chile was the ﬁrst country in Latin America to adopt an IT monetary regime. According to Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005), there have been two clear phases in the implementation of the inﬂation targeting regime in Chile. In the ﬁrst phase, when gaining credibility was a key issue, the Central Bank set short term horizon CPI inﬂation targets, and actively managed the exchange rate. In the second phase that started in 1999 the Central Bank moved to a fully ﬂexible exchange rate system, and adopted an explicit IT mechanism. Colombia formally implemented an IT strategy after the abandonment of exchange rate bands in 1999. Mexico formally adopted an IT framework in 2001, and from December 2003, a long term inﬂation target of 3 per cent was adopted with a variability interval of +/ − 1 percentage point. In Figure 2, I illustrate with a red vertical line the period which marks a change in the Mexican monetary regime. Finally, according to Broto (2008) Peru adopted an in 1994, although we follow some other studies which consider 2002 as the year of adoption of an explicit IT framework, as this target coincided with a money growth operational target. In summary, with the exception of Colombia, the period of estimation for each country includes some structural changes in the monetary policy regime.

Figure 2: Quarterly Inﬂation Rate for selected Latin American Countries
9According to Minella, Springer, Goldfajn and Kfoury (2003), this was caused by several external and domestic shocks, as a domestic energy crisis, the deceleration of the world economy and the Argentine crisis, which had signiﬁcant inﬂationary eﬀects.

Since the real marginal cost is a no observable variable and thus is must be estimated, in this thesis I use two approaches that are frequently used in the empirical work. First, I consider as a proxy the output gap. The output gap in this case is deﬁned as the deviation of real GDP from a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend. Because the HP ﬁlter is a smoothing method to obtain a smooth estimate of the long term component of a series (which in our case is the steady state), I need to deﬁne a number for the smoothing parameter. I choose as a value of the smoothing parameter 1600, which is the standard value for quarterly data10. Additionally, following Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011), this measure is normalized by its standard deviation to ensure comparable magnitudes across the sample countries. Figure 3 depicts the output gap for each country where I also include the inﬂation rate. In the case of Chile and Peru, inﬂation and output gap generally move in the same direction, while for Argentina and Brazil inﬂation and the output gap tend to move in opposite directions. Theoretically, higher output gaps are associated with an increase in marginal costs.Thus, all else being iqual, one should observe a positive association between the output gap and inﬂation. For some countries, Figure 3 may indicate some deﬁciencies of using the output gap as a proxy for real marginal cost. Of course, must be considered that the graphical approach is week, since the inﬂation rate is inﬂuenced by other factors. In addition, in the theoretical perspective of the NKPC, the output gap has a lagged eﬀect on inﬂation, which may make a visual relationship diﬃcult to detect.

marginal cost. In particular, Galí and Gertler (1999) have proposed the use of the unit labor cost wL
as a measure of the marginal cost, where this concept is deﬁned as , with w = wage, L = PY
number of workers and P Y = nominal GDP. In this case, however, because I use diﬀerent measures of unit labor cost (depending on data availability), the comparison across countries is limited. For the case of Argentina, Brazil and Colombia this variable was constructed using total compensations of the economy to workers divided by the nominal GDP, consistent with Galí and Gertler (1999). However, for the case of Chile and Mexico this approach was not possible. Instead, for Chile I use an index of real compensations constructed by the Central Bank of Chile, whereas for Mexico, I use the index of the unit labor cost of the manufacturing industry, which is published by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) 11. In order to avoid estimating relations between non-stationary variables that could be subject to the problem of spurious correlation, the trend for the unit labor cost measures is removed, using as detrending method the H-P ﬁlter.

In respect to the eﬀective terms of trade which is required for the open economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC, recall that it is deﬁned as the price of foreign goods in terms of home goods. I calculate the log diﬀerence of the import prices and the export prices for each country, which as discussed
11The main diﬀerence between the index of real compensations of Chile and the index of unit labor cost of Mexico is that the index of real compensations includes all the economic activities in Chile, while the index of Mexico includes only the manufacturing industry. As it noted above, for that reason the comparison is limited.

by Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011) implicitly gives the eﬀective terms of trade because the importance of the trading partners is automatically reﬂected in the deﬂators. The evolution of this variable it is shown in Figure 5. Because of the way in which the terms of trade are deﬁned, a decrease in this variable implies an improvement of the terms of trade. Hence, by inspection of Figure 5, the terms of trade have shown an improvement in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia (countries that are mainly exporters of primary goods), especially since 2008, when prices of raw materials and commodities increased. For Mexico, which exports are mainly manufactured goods, the terms of trade deteriorated in 2008, due to the impact generated by the increase in the price of raw materials.

Finally, to estimate the model speciﬁcation based on Holmberg (2006), for the cost measure of imported goods I use the imports of capital and intermediate goods as a share of the nominal GDP as a proxy of the imported goods used into the production. Following Holmberg (2006), this variable will be expressed as the percentage deviation from the mean. By inspection of Figure 6, for all the countries, with the exception of Chile, there is a growing trend in the imports of intermediate and capital goods as a proportion of nominal GDP.

5 Estimation Technique
The usual technique to estimate the parameters of the New Keynesian Phillips curve is to employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). In this section, I will brieﬂy summarize this method and discuss the reasons for using it. Before proceeding, I want to remark that by a moment I refer here to the moments of a distribution, which are a set of numerical descriptive measures that deﬁne a probability distribution (Gujarati, 2003). Following Wackerly, Mendenhall and Scheaﬀer (2007), a formal deﬁnition of moments can be established Deﬁnition 5.1. The kth moment of a random variable w taken about the origin is deﬁned to be E(wk).
Using an example to clarify this concept, consider the ﬁrst moment (which implies k = 1) of the random variable w. In this case, what we have is the expected value of the random variable, or, as Davidson and Mackinnon (2004) point out, the population mean of the random variable w, E(w) = µ, where µ is the common notation for the population mean. In general, the moments of the random variables are known as the population moments.
Returning to GMM, this is an estimator originally proposed by Hansen (1982), and is a generalization of the classical Method of Moments (MM). At this point, in order to facilitate the procedure of GMM, I am going to brieﬂy discuss the MM technique. The MM procedure makes use of the fact that a natural way to estimate parameters is to replace population moments by sample moments (Davidson and MacKinnon, 2004). Again, I can use the previous example to clarify this.
25

Suppose that I want to estimate E(w) = µ using MM. Then, according to this method, what I should do is to form an equation called the population moment condition, which in this example is E[w − µ] = 012. Solving this equation would give the value of µ that satisfy the population moment condition (2004). However, this population moment condition cannot be observed. Thus, based on the MM technique, the way to proceed is to replace the population moment condition with the sample moment condition, where the sample moment condition is
1T T (wi − µˆ) = 0
i=1
where T is the size of the available sample and µˆ is the estimator that solves the sample moment condition, i.e., is the estimator that makes that the expression of the left side of the equation be equal to zero. Now I can consider the general case of the MM technique. Following Greene (2008), it can be assumed that there are a set of L population moment conditions and K parameters of interest that should satisfy these moment conditions . Then, we can consider a model which involves K parameters, θ = (θ1, θ2, ..., θK). Let wt be a vector of random variables, θ be a K by 1 vector of parameters, and g be a L by 1 vector valued function whose expected value is zero in the population. Then, for the general case, the population moment condition can be deﬁned as:

E [g(wt, θ)] = 0

(5.1)

where 0 is a vector of zeros. From equation (5.1) it can be noted that by population moment condition we make reference to a function g (for the general case), that evaluated at the true value of the parameters θ, the expectation of that function is equal to zero. In equation (5.1), when the number of moment conditions are equal to the number of parameters, L = K, we have a system with the same number of equations as parameters. In this case, we can say that the system is identiﬁed. Solving these equations would give the value of θ that satisﬁes the moment conditions and this will be the true value of the parameters. However, E [g(wt, θ)] = 0 cannot be observed. Then, the population moment conditions in (5.1) are replaced with the sample moment condition which is

1T gt(w, θ) = T g(wt, θ) = 0
t=1

(5.2)

where T is again the size of the available sample. The parameter vector θ that solves equation (5.2) is the traditional MM estimator. Nevertheless, there are cases when the number of moment conditions are greater than the number
12In this case I am using the fact that the expected value of a constant is equal to the same constant, which implies E[µ] = µ

26

of parameters, L > K, and then, the system of equations given in (5.2) may not have an exact

solution, and then, it is not possible to use the MM technique. In cases like these, when L > K,

it is said that the system of equations is algebraically overidentiﬁed. In such cases, to use all the

information in the sample it is necessary to devise a way to reconcile the conﬂicting estimates that

may emerge from the overidentiﬁed system. It is in situations like these, when the GMM estimator

can be used. According to Green (2008), though it is generally not possible to ﬁnd an exact solution

for an overidentiﬁed system, the problem can be reformulated as one of choosing θ so that the

sample moment gt(w, θ) is as close to zero as possible, where close is deﬁned using the quadratic

form:

QT (θ) = gt(w, θ)´Wtgt(w, θ)

(5.3)

where Wt is a positive deﬁnite matrix L × L which will be discussed below. The GMM estimate is deﬁned as the θ that minimizes equation (5.3):

θˆ = argminQT (θ)

(5.4)

One important aspect of specifying a GMM estimator is the choice of Wt, which is called the weighting matrix. While it can be shown that any symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix Wt will

yield a consistent estimate of the vector of interest, the choice of the weighting matrix aﬀects the

asymptotic variance of the GMM estimator (Greene, 2008). Hansen (1982) show that a necessary

condition to obtain an asymptotically eﬃcient estimate of θ is to set Wt equal to the inverse of the

covariance matrix of the sample moments, i.e., if the covariance matrix is deﬁned as S0, then the

smallest asymptotic covariance matrix for an estimator θ that minimizes (5.5) is obtained by letting

Wt = S0−1:

QT (θ) = gt(w, θ)´S0−1gt(w, θ)

(5.5)

Under suitable regularity conditions, it can be shown that the GMM estimator which minimizes

(5.5) is consistent, asymptotically normally distributed and asymptotically eﬃcient (Mátyás, 1999).

There are three main reasons to use GMM to estimate the parameters of the NKPC. First, because it

is an estimation procedure that allows economic models to be speciﬁed while avoiding often unwanted

or unnecessary assumptions, such as specifying a particular distribution of the error term. Second,

I have a non-linear equation when I estimate the model of Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011),

and then traditional econometrics methods cannot be applied. Third, because the GMM solves the

problem of endogeneity that arises in the estimation, since the residuals are correlated with some

of the variables of the model. This can be shown from the empirical equations of the models that I

am going to estimate:

πt = λmct + βπt+1 + ut1

(5.6)

where ut1 = νt1 − β(πt+1 − Etπt+1)

πt = ξmct + λf Etπt+1 + λbπt−1 + ut2

(5.7)

27

where ut2 = νt2 − λf (πt+1 − Etπt+1)

πt = βπt+1 + λmct + α(∆st − β∆st+1) + ut3

(5.8)

where ut3 = νt3 − β(πt+1 − Etπt+1) + βα(∆st+1 − ∆Etst+1)

πt = Ω1lst + Ω2imst + βπt+1 + ut4

(5.9)

ut4 = νt4 − β(πt+1 − Etπt+1)

πt = Υf πt+1 + Υbπt−1 + λmct + α(∆st − βst+1) + ut5

(5.10)

where ut5 = νt5 − β(πt+1 − Etπt+1) + βα(∆st+1 − ∆Etst+1)

πt = κ1lst + κ2imst + λf πt+1 + λbπt−1 + ut6

(5.11)

where ut6 = νt6 − λf (πt+1 − Etπt+1)

It must be noted that the expected terms in all the equations have been replaced by their realization πt+1, whereas the expectational error is part of the residual in all the equations. For example, in the empirical equation (5.6) I use the value of the realization of πt+1 instead of the expectational term. Then, the forecast error (πt+1−Etπt+1) is now part of the residual, ut1. The same explanation applies for all the equations, but in the case of equations (5.8) and (5.10), the forecast error associated with the change in the terms of trade is also included in the residual term. Now, given that the residual in each equation is correlated with πt+1 in all the equations (and with ∆st+1 in equations (5.8) and (5.10)) an instrumental variable estimator is needed in order to guarantee unbiased results. In this case, I can use the structure of the GMM and the theoretical economic model to generate moment conditions that can be written as an orthogonality condition between the residuals of equations (4.6)-(4.11) and a vector of instruments Zt13 such that:

Et[utiZt] = 0

(5.12)

for all i=1,2,3,4,5 and 6. One thing must be made clear about equation (5.12). Under the assumption of rational expectations, the vector of instruments will include instruments dated t or earlier to rule out simultaneity issues. As will be seen in the next section, I will choose instruments dated t − 1 or earlier, because this guarantees that the information is already available at time t due to the potential publication lag. Solving for the error term in equations (5.6)-(5.11) and substituting in equation (5.12), I get the moment conditions that form the basis for estimating the model via GMM:

Et[(πt − λmct − βπt+1) Zt] = 0

(5.13)

13This can be done because one of the important characteristics to be a valid instrument it´s that the variable we are considering has to be uncorrelated with the error term.

28

Et[(πt − ξmct − λf πt+1 − λbπt−1) Zt] = 0

(5.14)

Et[(πt − βπt+1 − λmct − α(∆st − β∆st+1)) Zt] = 0

(5.15)

Et[(πt − Ω1lst − Ω2imst − βπt+1) Zt] = 0

(5.16)

Et[(πt − Υf πt+1 − Υbπt−1 − λmct − α(∆st − βst+1)) Zt] = 0

(5.17)

Et[(πt − κ1lst − κ2imst − λf πt+1 − λbπt−1)) Zt] = 0

(5.18)

One ﬁnal note about GMM. When there are more moments conditions than parameters to be estimated, which will be the case when I estimate the parameters of the model, a chi-square test can be used to test overidentifying restrictions. This statistic is called the J-statistic. The J statistic is used to test the validity of additional restrictions when the number of instruments is larger than the number of parameters to be estimated. The null hypothesis for this test is that additional restrictions are satisﬁed. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we must include diﬀerent instruments, since additional restrictions are not satisﬁed. (Davidson and MacKinnon, 2004)

6 Results
In this Section I discuss the empirical results of the various versions of the NKPC. The structure of this section is as follows. First, I present the results for the closed economy speciﬁcations of the NKPC, which include the baseline case and the hybrid representation. Then, I present the results for the open economy NKPC speciﬁcations. Finally, I compare my results with those of Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011) and Holmberg (2006). As was mentioned in Section 4 (data description), I use the output gap and the unit labor cost as proxies for real marginal cost for all the countries with the exception of Peru, because data of the unit labor cost were not available. In each table I report the p-values for all the parameters. Recall that the p-value is deﬁned as the lowest signiﬁcance level at which a null hypothesis can be rejected (Gujarati, 2004). If the p-value is smaller than a traditional level of signiﬁcance, for example, 10%, 5% or 1%, the null hypothesis must be rejected.
In relation to the instrumental variables used in each speciﬁcation of the NKPC, it is necessary to discuss the issues related with the instruments used. First, as Eichenbaum and Fisher (2003) point out, GMM estimations are sensitive to the size of the instrument set. To explore this possibility, I expand the instrument set to include more lags of each variable. Although these results are not reported, I found no meaningfully change in the parameters. Second, the literature has questioned inference using GMM methods in the presence of weak instruments (Stock and Yogo, 2002). In order to check the relevance of the instruments set used in the regressions, I follow the approach made by Galí and Gertler (1999) and for Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005), and test the null hypothesis that the coeﬃcients on all the instruments are jointly zero in the ﬁrst stage of the
29

estimation using the F-statistic. This is, I make a regression taking as dependent the endogenous variable (πt+1 and st+1 in the equations of Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011)) with respect to the instruments used in each speciﬁcation. If the null hypothesis that the instruments are jointly irrelevant is rejected, then the instruments used in the estimation could be considered as valid. These results are shown in tables (17) to (28) of the appendix, where I report the F-statistic, the associated p-value and the adjusted R2 from the ﬁrst stage regression for each speciﬁcation. For all the cases, the null hypothesis is rejected. Third, in each speciﬁcation I also report the J − statistics, which, as it was explained in the previous section, has a null hypothesis that additional restrictions are satisﬁed. Fourth, the instrumental variables used for each speciﬁcation are reported in appendix. Finally, since is a time series model, it is known that the presence of autocorrelation is highly probable. Because of this, I proceed to do the Ljung-Box test in each speciﬁcation, which cannot reject the null hypothesis that errors are not autocorrelated. To overcome this problem, we need to get robust standard errors. In order to do that, I choose the Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation (HAC) consistent estimator, because according to Gujarati (2003), this is the common way to proceed when we are working with time series.
6.1 Closed economy speciﬁcation
Table 4 reports the results for the baseline NKPC using the output gap, which is denoted with parameter κ, as a proxy for real marginal cost. The discount factor β is statistically signiﬁcant for all the countries in the sample, as it can be seen from the p-values, which in all the cases reject the null hypothesis that the coeﬃcients are statistically equal to zero. Additionally, the discount factor is positive and below one for each country, which is consistent with the theory. For this speciﬁcation of the NKPC, the highest discount factor is estimated for Argentina, while the lowest discount factor is for Chile. The economic implication of this will be explained below.
With respect to the parameter κ, there are some theoretical elements that could give us some intuition about the results that we should expect. Intuitively, higher output gaps are associated with an increase in marginal costs, which translate into higher prices, implying that the expected value of κ would be positive. Second, from a theoretical point of view, a higher discount factor, all else being equal, implies that ﬁrms gives more weight to future expected proﬁts (Walsh, 2010). The consequences of this, is that inﬂation is less sensitive to current marginal cost, i.e., the value of the parameter associated to output gap, κ, must be lower. Then, what should be expected is that in Chile, for example, the country with the lowest discount factor estimate, the impact of the parameter associated to the real variable should be greater, while the country with the highest discount factor estimate, which for this speciﬁcation is Argentina, the impact should be lower. However, what is observed from Table 4, is that in some cases, the outcomes are not what was expected. In the case of Chile, where we should expect that the coeﬃcient associated to the output gap to have
30

a greater value, even when the coeﬃcient has the expected sign (i.e. is positive), the coeﬃcient is not signiﬁcant. While the parameter κ is statistically signiﬁcant only for Brazil, Mexico and Peru, for the ﬁrst two countries the parameter is negative. In the case of Peru, this evidence suggest that output gap is an important determinant of inﬂation dynamics, and in fact, as will be shown below, this result is robust throughout diﬀerent speciﬁcations. It is important to stress however that this is a common result in many empirical works. Actually, some of these problems were pointed out in the data description section, where I depicted the output gap and the inﬂation rate (see Figure 3 of Section 4). In Section 4 I remarked that in the case of Argentina and Brazil, the inﬂation rate and the output gap move in opposite directions. As we can see in Table 4, for both these countries the sign of κ is indeed negative. Also, it was shown in Section 4 that for the case of Peru and Chile, inﬂation rand the output gap moved in same direction. This is also reﬂected in Table 4, where for both countries the sign of κ is positive (but for Chile the coeﬃcient is not signiﬁcant). Galí and Gertler (1999), have argued that a possible explanation of this negative sign for the output gap parameter is because conventional measures of the output gap are likely to be ridden with error, primarily due to the unobservability of the natural rate of output. In order to overcome this problem, several studies have proposed using the unit labor cost as a measure of real marginal cost in place of the output gap. The results of the estimation using unit labor costs are shown in Table 5. Finally, must be noted that the null hypothesis of the J − statistic that additional restrictions are satisﬁed, cannot be rejected for all the countries in Table 4. Actually, this will be the case for all the speciﬁcations estimated in the thesis.

As in Table 4, the results of the discount factor are signiﬁcant and consistent with the theory

(below 1 and positive). Again, the country with the lowest discount factor estimate is Chile. But

now, the country with the highest discount factor estimate is Colombia. From Table 5 we see that

replacing the output gap with unit labor cost as the proxy for real marginal cost tends to improve

the results, since now λ, the parameter associated with the unit labor cost, is statistically signiﬁcant

for Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. However, the problem of a negative sign is present again for

(1 − θ)(1 − βθ)

Argentina and Mexico. Recalling that λ =

, then a negative sign in the parameter

θ

λ would imply that the parameter that measure the degree of price rigidity, θ, will have values that

are not possible from the economic point of view14. A possible explanation of these outcomes is

that probably the real unit labor cost is a poor proxy for ﬁrms true marginal cost, as Rotemberg

and Woodford (1999) point out. They discuss some reasons why ﬁrms real marginal cost may vary

more with resource utilization in the economy than real unit labor cost (such as adjustment cost

of labor, the existence of overhead labor and other ﬁxed costs in production). This suggest that it

would seem important to develop alternative measures of real marginal cost in order to improve the

empirical ﬁt in the estimations for Latin American countries. However, this is beyond the scope of

this thesis, but it could represent an interesting direction for future research.

Hybrid speciﬁcation of the NKPC in a closed economy The results of the estimation
of the Hybrid NKPC are shown in Tables 6 and 7, where I present the speciﬁcations with the output gap and the unit labor cost, respectively. In Table 6 we see that for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, the coeﬃcient associated with the output gap it is not signiﬁcant and for Argentina, Brazil and Colombia the estimated parameter is of the wrong sign. The parameter κ is only signiﬁcant for Peru and Chile, and in both cases, has a positive value. It must be noted that in the case of
14This analysis is also true for parameter κ, since κ and λ are the same thing: the real marginal cost elasticity of inﬂation.

32

Peru, the parameter associated with the output gap was also signiﬁcant in the baseline speciﬁcation (Table 4). As discussed in Table 4, the results let to argue that the output gap is a determinant variable in the explanation of the inﬂation dynamics for Peru. In respect to the coeﬃcient associated with the backward looking component, we can see that it is signiﬁcant in all the cases15. Additionally, if we compare the coeﬃcients associated with the backward looking component against the coeﬃcient associated with the forward looking component (which is also signiﬁcant), it can be seen that, with the exception of Argentina and Chile, the backward looking parameter is higher than the forward looking parameter for the countries of the sample.

In all the cases, the null hypothesis of the validity of the overidentifying restrictions cannot be rejected.
Turning to the hybrid closed-economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC using the unit labor cost, the results are reported in Table 7. We can observe that the coeﬃcient associated with the unit labor cost presents similar problems to those previously discussed in Table 5, since for three of the ﬁve countries in the sample the coeﬃcient has a negative value (Argentina, Chile and Colombia). Additionally, it is only signiﬁcant for Brazil and Colombia. Until this point, it can be seen that for the case of Brazil, the coeﬃcient associated with the unit labor cost has been signiﬁcant in both the baseline and hybrid NKPC speciﬁcations. This suggests that there evidence that the unit labor cost plays a signiﬁcant role in the inﬂation dynamics for the Brazilian economy. Now, if we turn our attention to the coeﬃcients associated to the backward looking we can see that the results are consistent with those presented in Table 6, where a speciﬁcation of the output gap was used. As in Table 6, with the exception of Argentina and Chile, the coeﬃcient associated with the backward-looking component is greater than the coeﬃcient associated with the forward-looking component. In both tables, Chile is the country with the lowest backward looking coeﬃcient. Recall
15For Chile and Mexico, the results are consistent with the previous studies of Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005) and Ramos-Francia and Torres (2006), respectively.
33

that according to Céspedes, Ochoa and Soto (2005), inﬂationary inertia could be associated with low credibility levels of the central bank. Thus, in this case, a possible explanation for the values of the backward looking coeﬃcient in Chile, it could be associated with the idea that the monetary authorities in Chile have higher levels of credibility that other countries in the sample. The result obtained in the case of Chile, actually, it makes sense, since Chile was the ﬁrst country of the sample to implement IT. The opposite can be said about Brazil, since also in both tables, the backward looking component is the highest of the countries considered in the sample.

From the results presented in table 6 and 7, it can be concluded that, at least statistically, we can say that inﬂation inertia still has a key role in explaining the dynamics of inﬂation in Latin American countries.

This section has analyzed the case of a closed economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC. We identiﬁed at least two results. First, neither the output gap nor the unit labor cost, seem to be good proxies for real marginal cost, since with both speciﬁcations we found contradictory results. However, in the case of Peru it was observed that statistically speaking the output gap is an important determinant of inﬂation. And in the case of Brazil, it seems that the unit labor cost is an important factor in explaining Brazilian inﬂation dynamics. Another important result is the fact that the coeﬃcient associated with the backward-looking component in the hybrid speciﬁcation of the NKPC plays a key role in understanding inﬂation dynamics.

6.2 Open economy speciﬁcation
Small Open Economy model: The approach of Galí and Monacelli In Table 8, I
report the results for the basic open-economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC derived using the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005). As in the closed economy speciﬁcation, the discount factor is signiﬁcant for all the countries in the sample. For this coeﬃcient, the results are quite similar with those of the closed economy case, except for Chile, the discount factor is now above 0.90. With respect to κ, the parameter that measures the impact of the output gap on the inﬂation rate, we see that, even though it is signiﬁcant for ﬁve out of the six countries in the sample, in the cases of Brazil and Mexico, the sign associated with κ is negative, a problem that was also found and discussed in the closed economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC. An important point to remark about this parameter is that, for Peru, the result of κ is signiﬁcant and with the expected sign, which seems to support the idea that the output gap is a determinant variable to explain the dynamic of inﬂation in Peru.

In all the cases, the null hypothesis of the validity of the overidentifying restrictions cannot be rejected.
For the estimates of α, the parameter I am most interested in this speciﬁcation of the NKPC which measures the degree of trade openness in the economy (and for that reason a negative estimate for α is inconsistent with this interpretation) it is signiﬁcant for Brazil, Chile and Mexico, but in the case of Chile the estimated parameter is negative. It is important to stress that Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011) also get negative values for α in their results. They argue that the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) does not fully capture all factors inﬂuencing the impact of the terms of trade ﬂuctuations on inﬂation dynamics, thereby explaining why negative estimates can arise. In particular, the assumption that exporting ﬁrms engage in full producer currency pricing may not be appropriate if ﬁrms implement local currency

35

pricing. This argument also seems to be appropriate for the countries of Latin America. One way the empirical literature can test the presence of local currency pricing is by analyzing the degree of exchange rate pass-through. When the degree of exchange rate pass-through is equal to one, the full currency pricing assumptions is satisﬁed. However, when the degree of exchange rate pass-through is less than 1, then the local currency pricing exists. Bussiére, Delle Chaie and Peltonen (2014) in a study about the exchange rate pass-through ﬁnd that, even when the pass-through eﬀect is higher for emerging markets than for developed economies, the pass through eﬀect it is not complete for emerging markets (including Latin American countries). They estimate the following values for the degree of exchange rate pass-through: 0.464 for Argentina, 0.362 for Brazil, 0.476 for Chile and 0.577 for Mexico. This could explain not only the negative sign for Chile and Colombia in both tables, but also the low values of α that I get for all the countries with the exception of Mexico16.
The results when I use the unit labor cost as a proxy to the real marginal cost are reported in Table 9. As in previous speciﬁcations, the results of the discount factor are signiﬁcant for all the levels of signiﬁcance. For the parameter λ, we see that it is signiﬁcant for Argentina, Chile and Colombia. And as in previous results, for some countries, the sign associated with this parameter is negative. In this case, however, unlike the results for the closed-economy speciﬁcation, the parameter of the unit labor cost for Brazil, even though it has the correct sign, it is not signiﬁcant. For the case of the degree of trade openness parameter, α, we see that similar to Table 8, it is signiﬁcant for Brazil, Chile and Mexico, with Mexico being the country with the highest coeﬃcient in the sample (and this is true also in Table 8). These results can be interpreted as evidence that for these three countries, the terms of trade, appears to be a relevant factor in explaining inﬂation dynamics. This result seem to be sensible for the case of Chile and Mexico, since as was discussed in Section 2, these countries have the highest level of openness to trade. But the results for Brazil are not so intuitive, since the degree of openness for Brazil is the lowest of the countries in the sample (see Table 2).
16This could be an evidence of the explanation made by Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011), since according to the study of Bussiére, Delle Chaie and Peltonen (2014), Mexico is the country with the highest coeﬃcient of pass-through, and then, is probably that the model ﬁts better with the Mexican case.

The Holmberg’s approach Now, I present the results of the model of Holmberg (2006). In
order to compare the results of this model with the previous results obtained for the model of Galíand Monacelli (2005), I ﬁrst consider a special case of this model when the number of backward looking ﬁrms is equal to zero. As it has been done in previous examples, I ﬁrst report place the results using the output gap as a proxy for real marginal cost. In Table 10 we see that for all countries the discount factor is statistically signiﬁcant, which has been the case in the previous NKPC speciﬁcations. Additionally, it seems to be the case that for the open economy NKPC speciﬁcations, the discount factor of Chile is greater than the estimate obtained using the closed economy speciﬁcation, since once again the value of the discount factor is above 0.90. With respect to the parameter associated to output gap, it is signiﬁcant for four countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. It must be noted again that in the case of Peru, the parameter associated to the output gap has been signiﬁcant for all the estimations that I have considered. Actually, Chile, with the exception of the ﬁrst table, this parameter has been also signiﬁcant for all the estimations. In addition, an element that is also important, is the fact that in both countries the sign associated with the output gap has been positive. The parameter Ω2 measures the impact of the change of capital and intermediate imports as a proportion of the nominal GDP. In this sense, the parameter Ω2 represent a measure of the impact of international elements on the dynamic of inﬂation. The results for this parameter show that it is signiﬁcant for Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru. Comparing these results with those of the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005), it can be seen that for the cases of Brazil, Chile and Mexico, openeconomy NKPC models seems to be more appropriate than those of the closed -economy case.

In Table 11, we show the results of the same model but using the unit labor cost proxy. The results are similar to those found in the Table 10. The discount factor is signiﬁcant for all the countries, and again for the case of Chile the discount factor is above 0.90. With respect to values of the parameter associated to the unit labor cost, we see that it is signiﬁcant for three countries, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. But for all these cases in which the coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant, the value of the parameter is negative. Finally, for the parameter Ω2, we see that is signiﬁcant only for Mexico and Chile, which is consistent with the previous results found for the open economy NKPC speciﬁcation. However, now this parameter is not signiﬁcant for Brazil, which could generate some doubts about the validity of the above results using output gaps.

Hybrid speciﬁcation of the open economy models
The approach of Galí and Monacelli In Table 12, I report the results of the hybrid
version of the NKPC derived from the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) using the output gap as the proxy for the real marginal cost. We see that in this case, there is a signiﬁcant change with respect to the values of the parameters associated to the forward and backward-looking components obtained in the closed-economy version. Even though for all the countries these coeﬃcients are signiﬁcant (as was the case in Tables 6 and 7), the results show that now, with the exception of Argentina, the value of the parameter of the forward-looking component is higher than the coeﬃcient of the backward-looking component. However, given the high values of the coeﬃcient of the backward looking component the statement about the key role that the inertia plays for Latin American countries still remain. For the case of the parameter κ, we see that it is positive and signiﬁcant again for Chile and Peru, which is in line with the previous speciﬁcations. In addition, the coeﬃcient is also signiﬁcant for Argentina and Brazil, but in these cases, the value of the parameter is negative. Finally, for α we can see that for this speciﬁcation, it is signiﬁcant for all the countries. Of course these results do not let us to conclude anything, since it seems to be the case that the values of the coeﬃcients are sensitive to diﬀerent speciﬁcations, it is not possible to conclude that for all the countries international factors are an important determinant of the inﬂation rate. Actually, given the results that have been obtained, such an asseveration could be only possible for the cases of Chile and Mexico.

The results of the hybrid version of the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) using the unit labor cost as a proxy for the real marginal cost are presented in Table 13. It can be seen that the coefﬁcient of the backward and forward-looking components are signiﬁcant for all countries. Also the

39

forward-looking coeﬃcient is greater than the backward looking coeﬃcient for Argentina, Chile and Mexico. With respect to the coeﬃcient λ, we see that is signiﬁcant for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. It must be noted that until now, it has not been possible to ﬁnd a strong association between the unit labor cost and the inﬂation rate for any country using the open economy speciﬁcation of the NKPC. We must to remember that in the closed economy version of the NKPC, I found that for the case of Brazil the unit labor cost was a determinant variable to explain the dynamics of the inﬂation rate. However, in the open economy case the evidence does not seem conclusive, since it has been signiﬁcant only for this speciﬁcation. For α, the results suggest that it is signiﬁcant as usual, for Brazil, Chile and Mexico. In addition, for this speciﬁcation it is also signiﬁcant for Argentina.

Holmberg’s approach: An hybrid speciﬁcation In Table 14, I report the results us-
ing the output gap as the proxy for the real marginal cost. In the case of the parameters associated with the forward and backward-looking components are signiﬁcant for all the countries in the sample. Here, the forward-looking component is greater than the backward-looking component only for Argentina and Chile, similar to the results found in the closed economy speciﬁcation. In the case of κ1, the coeﬃcient associated with the output gap, it can be seen that it is signiﬁcant for Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. The results found for Chile and Peru is consistent with the results found under alternative NKPC speciﬁcations, which could be seen as evidence of the importance of the output gap for inﬂation dynamics in these countries. Finally, the coeﬃcient associated with the share of imports of intermediate and capital goods, κ2, it is signiﬁcant for Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Again, the results suggest that in the case of Chile and Mexico, international factors, in this case the imports of inputs used in the process of production, seems to be an important determinant of the inﬂation rate.

Finally, the results with the unit labor cost as proxy for real marginal cost are presented in Table 15. We can see that in this case, the coeﬃcient of the unit labor cost is signiﬁcant for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, but in the case of Colombia, the problem of the wrong sign is present again. With respect to the coeﬃcient associated with the forward-looking and the backward-looking components, we can see that are high and signiﬁcant for all countries. For the last coeﬃcient, the coeﬃcient associated to the share of the imports of capital and intermediate, the results shown that it is signiﬁcant for three countries of the sample, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. This result conﬁrms that an open economy model explains better the dynamics of inﬂation in the economies of Chile and Mexico.

6.3 Conclusions of the section
As ﬁnal point of analysis, the results that were obtained in this section are compared with those of the works of Mihailov, Rumler and Sharler (2011) (MRS henceforth) and Holmberg (2006).
MRS (2011) make several estimates of the model of Galí and Monacelli (2005) that was developed above. They use three proxies for the real marginal cost: the deviation of the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from a quadratic polynomial trend, the deviation of real GDP from a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend and the real unit labor cost. To compare results, I only consider the deviation of real GDP from the HP trend, since it was the procedure used in this thesis to obtain the output gap. Additionally, the results obtained when the unit labor cost is used are similar, and then the qualitatyve analysis will be the same. Thus, the equation under analysis is:
πt = βπt+1 + κyt + α(∆st − β∆st+1) + ut3
The results of this thesis and the results of MRS (2011) are similar in three aspects: the parameter β is signiﬁcant and above 0.85 for both results; the parameter associated to output gap is signiﬁcant for a few countries and in some cases, negative; and the parameter α is signiﬁcant only for half of the sample. However, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the results that I get and the results of MRS (2011) is related with the size of parameter α. Since the diﬀerences are considerable, it is worthwhile to show both results. In Table 16, I report the results for the countries with a signiﬁcant α for both, the results of this section and the results of the article of MRS (2011).

Notes: ∗The estimation period is 1970:1-2007:4. ∗∗ The estimation period is diﬀerent for each country. See Table 3 in Section 4 for the period estimated for each country. The stars attached to the coeﬃcient estimates show signiﬁcance levels, where ∗ denotes signiﬁcance at the 10%, ∗∗ at the 5% and ∗∗∗ at the 1% level.

Diﬀerences in values of the coeﬃcients are substantial. In addition, all the signiﬁcant results for the model of MRS (2011) are positive. A possible explanation for these results is the signiﬁcant

42

diﬀerence in the size of the sample, which in the case of MRS (2011) could generate more precise estimates.
With respect to Holmberg (2006), she estimates several speciﬁcations of equation
πt = κ1lst + κ2imst + λf πt+1 + λbπt−1 + vt6
for Sweden for the period 1986:01- 2004:4. In each speciﬁcation, she uses diﬀerent index to measure the quarterly inﬂation rate: the GDP deﬂator, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and an index of the core inﬂation. Since in this work we are considering as a measure of inﬂation the quarterly percentage change of the CPI, I am going to consider only the speciﬁcation of the CPI in order to be able to compare. In addition, she uses as proxies for real marginal cost, the output gap and the unit labor cost, in the same spirit of the present work. But for the speciﬁcation that uses the CPI as dependent variable, she only estimates the above equation using the unit labor cost. For that reason, the results are compared only for this speciﬁcation. Her results shown that it was not possible to ﬁnd evidence of the impact of the labor share and the imports of intermediate goods (parameters κ1 and κ2, respectively.) in current inﬂation. Comparing with our results, a similar conclusion can be done only for the case of Argentina, since for other countries at least one coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant. For the coeﬃcients that measure the impact of future and lag inﬂation, she establishes a restriction: that the sum of both be equal to one, this is:
λ1 + λ2 = 1
Their results suggest that, in line with Galí and Gertler (1999), the expectations about future inﬂation are more important for explaining inﬂation than past inﬂation for Sweden, since the coeﬃcient λf is equal to 0.746, implying that given the restriction she imposes, the coeﬃcient λb be equal to 0.254. Of course, this results are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to our ﬁndings, since for any country of our sample, the value of λf was greater than 0.6, as can be observed in Table 15. Thus, in this case the main diﬀerence is related with the size of the forward-looking component, λf which is higher than those of the values in Table 15.
7 Conclusions
In this thesis I have estimated several speciﬁcations of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) using the technique of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to analyze what are the main drivers of inﬂation dynamics for six Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The relevance of this it is twofold. First, given the scarce literature for the analysis of inﬂation dy-
43

namics for developing economies using the NKPC, we contribute here estimating diﬀerent versions of the NKPC for a set of Latin American countries. Second, considering the characteristics of these economies and their changes during the last two decades, it is important to analyze how this changes are reﬂected in the evolution of aggregate prices. In order to analyze this, I ﬁrst estimated versions of the NKPC under a closed economy speciﬁcation. The main ﬁndings for the closed economy speciﬁcations are as follows. First, it could not be established a strong statistical relationship between the inﬂation rate and the variables used as proxies to real marginal cost for many Latin American countries. One remarkable exception has been Peru, since for the speciﬁcations estimated in the closed economy case, it was possible to pin down a statistical relationship between output gap and the inﬂation rate. This evidence suggests that output gap is an important determinant of the inﬂationary process in this country. Second, we found that both, the forward looking component and the backward looking component of the hybrid version of the NKPC are important components to explain the inﬂation dynamics for the Latin American countries considered in this thesis. This results also suggest that even when inﬂation expectations are an important variable to describe the inﬂation dynamics for these countries, inertia also play a key role, which is in diﬀerence with the ﬁndings for developed countries.
When we extend the analytical framework of the NKPC to an open economy speciﬁcation based on the models of Galí and Monacelli (2005) and Holmberg (2006), the main results of the closed economy speciﬁcations remain. This is, for most of the countries of the sample neither the output gap nor the unit labor cost seems to properly describe the inﬂation dynamics for the countries considered in the sample, with the exception of Peru. However, we found strong statistical evidence relating to the impact that the terms of trade and the imports of intermediate and capital goods have in the inﬂationary processes for Chile and Mexico. This results show that for these two countries, Chile and Mexico, an open economy version of the NKPC describes better the inﬂationary process.
As a ﬁnal consideration, we think that to overcome some of the problems that arise in the present work, as the sign of the proxies for the real marginal cost, it is necessary a deepest research into the study of the NKPC, in order to properly characterize such a fundamental variable, as is in fact, the level of aggregate prices in the economy.
