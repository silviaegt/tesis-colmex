Abstract
This dissertation comprises three self-contained essays examining household behavior by means of the collective framework. In particular, it takes into account the resources invested in children’s welfare and adult household members’ decisions to participate in the labor market. The collective approach assumes that multi-person households do not act as a single unit, but that each member has his or her own preferences and that household allocations are the result of a Pareto e¢ cient bargaining process between them. Therefore, resources invested in children’s welfare would depend not only on the household budget set but also on the parents’individual preferences and their relative position in decision making. Additionally, if household members’wages have an in‡uence on bargaining positions, even if they are not actually working, then any variation in the potential wage will change household allocations.
Chapter 1 estimates a structural collective model of household labor supply with children and home production for a sample of Mexican families. The framework of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005) is used to address the manner in which household allocations are a¤ected by the intra-household decision-making process when both parents care for their children’s welfare, particularly their education. In households with characteristics at the sample average, more household resources are directed toward children’s education when the balance of bargaining power tips from mothers to fathers. Moreover, in spite of mothers having a larger estimated marginal willingness to pay for resources associated with children’s utility, more expenditures and time would be dedicated to children when fathers’bargaining power increases exogenously, and less when it decreases. These results draw attention to the design of targeting strategies which assume that mothers care more for children than fathers; these may be less e¤ective in some cases than if they had been focused on increasing fathers’ power.
Chapter 2 extends the collective model of household behavior to consider public consumption, like expenditures on children, together with the possibility of non-participation

ABSTRACT
in the labor market of one partner of the adult couple. This model argues that structural elements of the decision process, such as individual preferences and the intra-household distribution rule of non-public expenditure, can be identi…ed by observing the labor supply for each individual and total expenditure on the public good. The identi…cation rests on the existence of a variable that a¤ects household behavior only through its impact on the decision process, i.e., a distribution factor, and the existence and uniqueness of a reservation wage for each household member at which both members are indi¤erent to whether a member participates or not. This setting provides a conceptual framework for addressing issues related to the impact of the potential wage of a non-participating member on household allocations and the targeting of speci…c bene…ts or taxes.
Finally, chapter 3 presents an empirical application of the collective household labor supply model of the previous chapter. A simultaneous model for female participation, hours worked by the couple, and expenditures on children is postulated and the set of parametric restrictions imposed by the collective rationality is derived. A subsample of the same database employed in chapter 1 is used to estimate this model and test the restrictions implies it. The collective rationality is not rejected by the data. The collective model is estimated using a sample of Mexican nuclear families in which the male partner works, and no evidence is found that empowering mothers is more bene…cial to children than empowering fathers in terms of their marginal willingness to pay. Expenditures on children and the male labor supply also change signi…cantly with variation in the female wage, even when the woman is not working. However, parameters related to the auxiliary assumptions of the continuity of the male labor supply, and expenditures on children along the female’s participation frontier, are not precisely estimated.

Parental Investment in Children’s Education
1.1 Introduction
Does a change in the decision process between parents a¤ect resources directed to children’s welfare? A better understanding of the intra-household decision-making process could give us an idea of how di¤erences in preferences between household members a¤ect some individual outcomes, particularly those relevant to the welfare of speci…c individuals, such as the human capital of children. In order to answer this question, this study proposes a structural collective model of household labor supply with children and home production for a sample of Mexican families. Examination of the decision process and of the production of children’s utility shows no evidence that mothers care more for their children than fathers in households with characteristics at the sample average. Indeed, there is a larger increase in the resources directed to children’s utility when the change in relative wage favors the father instead of the mother. Furthermore, there is an increase in resources directed to children when the Pareto weight of the father increases via an exogenous change that does not in‡uence the household budget constraint (and a corresponding reduction in resources accompanying an increase in Pareto weight of the mother). This suggests the need for analysis of behavior in households where children are present, and the possible role of parental bargaining to explain the choice of household outcomes, the scarcity of evidence for the decision process in Mexico, and the means by which a collective labor supply model could address a setting in which both parents care for their children.
Numerous empirical studies have found evidence of a relation between factors that
1

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION
may in‡uence the distribution of power among household members and intrahousehold allocations. Changes in favor of a household member are associated with consumption patterns in bene…t of his or her preferences. Control over economic resources is considered in some studies as a cause of di¤erent observed household behaviors. Examples of variables used are the recipient identity of non-labor income (Thomas 1990; Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori, and Lechene 1994), assets (Quisumbing 1994; Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003; Thomas, Contreras, and Frankenberg 2004), and shares of income earned (Hoddinott and Haddad 1995; Bittman, England, Folbre, Sayer, and Matheson 2003). Other factors that a¤ect the household environment and outside opportunities have been considered, including legislation and the marriage market (Gray 1998; Chiappori, Fortin, and Lacroix 2002; Park 2007), and relative skills and knowledge (Beegle, Frankenberg, and Thomas 2001; Rubalcava and Contreras 2000; Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003).
Moreover, quasi-natural experiments, such as targeted transfers and changes in welfare programs, have been used to analyze how household allocations respond to potential changes in intrahousehold decision process. Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997) and Du‡o (2000) provide evidence in favor of targeting strategies that could improve child welfare, the former analyzing a change in the UK child allowance policy in the late 1970s and the second a reform of the South African old-age pension program.
In general terms, in Mexico there is no evidence of household decision process that simultaneously considers changes in bargaining power distribution in favor of either parent and parental time and expenditure on children’s education. Various studies have analyzed household behavior through the conditional cash transfer program known as Oportunidades (previously Progresa), which was launched by the Mexican government in 1997 with the main objective of improve the education, nutrition, and health of Mexican families with children in extreme poverty. Guided by the hypothesis that women are more willing than other household members to spend the money received in a way that bene…ts children, the program is designed to give a direct cash bene…t to the mother (or the most senior woman in the family). The literature reports mixed results of this additional money on household consumption patterns and whether it is spent di¤erently than others household income (in favor of a change: Attanasio and Lechene 2002; Rubalcava, Teruel, and Thomas 2009; against: Handa, Peterman, Davis, and Stampini 2009). Moreover, household monetary expense is not necessarily the sole factor used to enhance the human capital of a child. It could present an incomplete picture of household allocation to children’s human capital formation, given that increases in expenditure on children may be accompanied by a reallocation of other factors dedicated to their education.
2

1.1. INTRODUCTION
Since the recipient of Progresa/Oportunidades is always a woman in the house, it is not possible to compare what would happen if the additional money were given to a male member. However, Gutiérrez, Juárez, and Rublí (2011) study a program that gives an exogenous, non-labor additional income to both sexes. They use a pension program for elderly people resident in Mexico city (in Spanish, PAAAM: Pensión Alimentaria para Adultos Mayores) to compare the impact on children’s outcomes of giving the transfer to a male or a female. The extra money is associated with greater expenditures on children between 6 and 18 years old if the recipient is a female, but it is related to a greater enrollment rate if the recipient is a male. However because the family tie with the child is not analyzed, the policy implications are limited.
Although some of the empirical evidence suggests that favorable changes in mothers’ bargaining power (generally in terms of economic resources) bene…t child welfare, meaning that "mothers care more for children than fathers," the lens used to interpret this type of observed behavior is crucial to policy issues. Design of policy interventions under presumptions such as "children are better o¤ if the mother’s in‡uence in the household is increased, rather than the father’s" may fail to improve child welfare if the channel by which parents’ individual preferences and household decision process are re‡ected in children’s outcomes is unknown.
With this in mind, the theoretical framework on which most of these studies are based is the “collective” approach. In contrast to the “unitary” view, in which the household maximizes a unique utility function (as if its members act as a single rational individual), the resources allocated to the well-being of a speci…c household member under the collective model could vary depending on both the preferences of its members and the distribution of the bargaining power between them, even when total resources are kept constant. Therefore, intra-household allocation processes could mitigate or enhance public policies involving individual welfare.
It is possible to tackle the question of household behavior when children are present assuming that both parents obtain utility (although not necessarily to the same degree) from the welfare of their o¤spring, meaning that it is a public good for them. However, until Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005) (hereafter, BCM), the collective approach had not adequately developed a theoretical framework to analyze households with children. The principal results under this approach have been obtained in the case of private goods, but not when public consumption was also present.
The BCM model is basically an extension of Chiappori’s (1992) collective model of
3

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION
household labor supply where both parents care about their children’s welfare and where children’s utility can also be augmented by means of speci…c expenditures and parental time. One of the main results of the BCM model is that increases in the bargaining power of a parent result in more resources directed to children only when his or her willingness to pay for children’s welfare is more sensitive to increases in his or her private consumption. Therefore, the key aspect is not that, for example, a mother cares more about the children than the father (i.e., that she has a larger willingness to pay), but that she is more willing to spend on the children when there is an increased household budget share for her private consumption.
The objective of this chapter is to examine the e¤ects of changes in the distribution of power between parents over intra-household resource allocation directed to children’s human capital, particularly education. To this end, the BCM model is identi…ed using a particular parametrization and an estimation strategy based on Cherchye, de Rock, and Vermeulen (2010; forthcoming) (hereafter, CRV). The sample is drawn from the second wave of the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS-2/ENNVIH-2, for its abbreviation in Spanish) and focused on Mexican nuclear families, with children only under 15 years of age and at least one school-age child, where both parents work. Changes in factors that in‡uence the Pareto weights are used to assess how resources directed to children’s education respond to changes in the distribution of the bargaining power.
The structure of the remainder of this chapter is as follows. Section 1.2 reviews the economic literature on the analysis of household behavior. Section 1.3 presents the BCM theoretical model. The estimation strategy applied, data set used, and empirical results are explained in section 1.4. Section 1.5 provides some …nal remarks.
1.2 Households in the Economic Literature
Traditionally, neo-classical consumer models are based on individual rational preference ordering over a¤ordable consumption bundles. A …rst theoretical approximation to taking the household into account in economics is to transform the consumer choice problem from an individual to a household perspective. Household members’utilities and budget constraints can be systematically added, assuming either that they all have homogeneous preferences, that an altruistic household head has all the power at home, or that the weights of individuals within a household welfare function are …xed.

1.2. HOUSEHOLDS IN THE ECONOMIC LITERATURE
This type of approximation is commonly known as the “unitary” model. It has the advantage of imposing empirical restrictions on household behavior: the demand functions depend on prices and …xed income, and these functions have to satisfy the standard axioms of individual preferences. Moreover, because the …xed income of household members is aggregated, the identity of the recipient does not a¤ect the assignment, a factor known as the “income pooling”hypothesis.
The main implications of the unitary framework -the income pooling hypothesis and the symmetry of the Slutsky matrix- have been rejected in several empirical studies. Contradicting the income pooling hypothesis, the distribution of income has been found to be signi…cant in the allocation of family resources in the studies of Thomas (1990); Bourguignon, Browning, Chiappori, and Lechene (1993); Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori, and Lechene (1994); Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997); Fortin and Lacroix (1997); among others. The symmetry of the Slutsky matrix for demands of households with more than one member has been rejected by Browning and Meghir (1991); Fortin and Lacroix (1997); Browning and Chiappori (1998); among others.
In addition to this accumulation of empirical evidence against the unitary model, there are also concerns about the understatement of poverty and inequality levels that do not consider intra-household distribution of resources (Haddad and Kanbur 1990) and the e¢ cacy and consequences of policies under this framework (Apps and Rees 1988; Alderman, Chiappori, Haddad, Hoddinott, and Kanbur 1995; Beninger, Bargain, Beblo, Blundell, Carrasco, Chiuri, Laisney, Lechene, Longobardi, Moreau, Myck, Ruiz-Castillo, and Vermeulen 2006).
A number of approaches seek to overcome these problems while respecting the theoretical foundations of individual preferences, attempting to explain the internal dynamics between individuals with heterogeneous preferences and the manner in which disagreements between them are resolved. Among these, a fruitful approach, based on minimal assumptions, is the “collective” model.1 Applying the context of bargaining theory, household members with non-homogeneous preferences are trying to come to an agreement on how to assign the household gains. The outcome of this decision-making process depends on the relative bargaining power of members to “impose”their preferences.
1 Another approach to analyzing the household decision process is the non-cooperative model. Within this framework, household members maximize their utility relative to their budget constraint, taking as given the behavior of the other members. A drawback of this approach is that in the solution found for these models it is possible to improve the welfare of one member without worsening that of other members if the resulting intrahousehold allocation is changed (see Xu 2007 and Donni and Chiappori 2011 for a more extensive discussion of non-cooperative models).
5

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION
Without assuming a speci…c bargaining concept, the collective model assumes that the intra-household decisions are Pareto e¢ cient (i.e., it is not possible to increase the welfare of one member without decreasing that of the others). This assumption is supported by the idea that household members can be seen as playing a repeated game where there is symmetry of information.
This setting is characterized by a weighted utilitarian household welfare function where the Pareto weights of each household member depend on prices, total household expenditure, and external factors that a¤ect the decision process but not individual preferences or the joint budget set ("Extrahousehold Environmental Parameters," in the terminology of McElroy 1990, or "Distribution Factors," in the terminology of Browning and Chiappori 1998).2 The idea behind the introduction of distribution factors to the collective model is to serve as an additional source of variation (di¤erent from that obtained by prices, wages, and non-labor income) to more precisely predict household behavior (Browning, Chiappori, and Weiss 2011). By considering private and public goods in the collective model, the distribution factors can serve to isolate the e¤ect of public consumption (say, paying for childcare) on individual preferences (say, the individual trade-o¤ between labor supply and private consumption), facilitating the recovery of individual preferences on private and public goods and the decision process (BCM). Various types of distribution factors have been used in the literature (see Table A.1), especially those associated with control over economic resources. These have included assets (current, at marriage), unearned income, targeted transfers, changes in welfare programs (such as coverage and bene…ts), and share of income earned by women.
One of the implications of the collective model is that it is not necessary to satisfy the income pooling hypothesis. Consequently, there is the possibility of targeting a speci…c household member for a public transfer, taking into account possible resource reallocations from non-bene…ciaries to the bene…ciary that could diminish or enhance the transfer’s e¤ectiveness. It is thus possible to propose policies that directly a¤ect bargaining power, such as those regarding eligibility rules for training programs or rights to alimony and child support
2 Under the axiomatic bargaining theory, household decisions represent the outcome of some bargaining process between its members (represented by Nash or Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions). Individuals compare the utility level achieved if they cooperate (the gains of living together) with the level obtained if they do not cooperate. Therefore, the non-cooperative utility of a member serves as a threat point to obtain more power in the bargaining process. Changes in distribution factors thus shift the threat points and therefore the Pareto weights. Threat points can be interpreted as the utility of being divorced or remaining single (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981), or a noncooperative equilibrium within marriage that re‡ects traditional gender roles and gender role expectations (“separate spheres” bargaining model of Lundberg and Pollak 1993).

1.3. INTRODUCING CHILDREN INTO THE COLLECTIVE APPROACH
for ex-wives and children of divorced parents (Alderman, Chiappori, Haddad, Hoddinott, and Kanbur 1995; Quisumbing and McCla¤erty 2006).
Two studies for Mexico that take into account some aspects of the collective approach are Martinelli and Parker (2008) and Bobonis (2009). In the former the authors try to isolate the substitution e¤ect of Progresa/Oportunidades school subsidies from the e¤ects of income and bargaining on the share of expenditures devoted to children’s clothing. Bobonis tests the Pareto e¢ ciency assumption of collective models in household decisions. He uses as changes in distribution factors the exogenous variation in women’s income due to Progresa/Oportunidades and household income variation occasioned by localized rainfall shocks. The allocations of various household items are used as dependent variables, with the …nding, among other e¤ects, that income changes due to Progresa/Oportunidades have a positive e¤ect on household budget shares for adult female and children’s clothing and a negative e¤ect on alcohol and tobacco shares, while those due to rainfall shock have the opposite e¤ects. He interprets these …ndings as evidence of how women’s control over a sum of money in low-resource households is used in a family-friendly way (probably responding to social pressures) while income closer to the male sphere is used in favor of the man.
1.3 Introducing Children into the Collective Approach
The presence of children generates particular dynamics that must be considered in the study of household behavior. It is possible to model children’s welfare as a nonmarket good produced within the household by reallocating market and non-market resources to its production (Bourguignon 1999).
Collective models of household production assume that households obtain utility not only of market goods but also of non-market goods produced within the household. These models commonly concentrate on how the labor supply of household members is a¤ected when agents divide their time among market activities, leisure, and domestic production.3
3 Besides avoiding omitted-variable problems, the introduction of household production into the analysis has e¤ects on the interpretation of intra-household welfare. Apps and Rees (1996; 1997) point out that if household production is not considered, low or zero levels of market labor from of one individual is interpreted as a larger leisure consumption, and his or her share of household income is interpreted as a lump-sum transfer from the other members. However, the inclusion of household production considers the division of labor between household and market production. It may be that one member specializes in domestic production; if he or she exchanges such production with the other members for market goods, there is an exchange instead of a transfer. Chiappori (1997) identi…es some basic points of the collective model when household production is included.
7

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION
Children’s utility can be also interpreted as a form of household production. Taking the BCM model of collective labor supply with children and home production, the behavior of two-adult household with children can be modeled in the following manner. Suppose that there are two adult members in a household, where the mother is denoted by m and the father by f . Three commodities are consumed in a household: individual leisures Lm; Lf , and a Hicksian composite good C that is used for private expenditure Cm; Cf and some public consumption (K) for the production of children’s utility:
C = Cm + Cf + K
Individual time is allocated between leisure (Li), market work (hW i ), and production of children’s welfare (hKi ):
Li + hW i + hKi = T
Children’s welfare uK 4 is produced using speci…c expenditure and parental time:
uK = uK K; hmK ; hKf
The utility function of parent i depends on the consumption of his or her consumption of individual goods and children’s utility (in some sense children are considered as a public consumption good to the adult household members; the latter have caring preferences about children’s welfare):
U i = U i Li; Ci; uK i = m; f
All utility functions are strictly quasiconcave and increasing, and at least twice continuously di¤erentiable.
Wages are denoted by wm and wf , and the price of the Hicksian good is normalized to one. Given the household …xed income, y, the budget constraint is:
Cm + Cf + K = wmhW m + wf hW f + y
4 This function has non-increasing returns and no joint production.
8

1.3. INTRODUCING CHILDREN INTO THE COLLECTIVE APPROACH
Assuming that the decisions made by the household are Pareto-e¢ cient, that parents share bargaining power and children do not have any, and considering the existence of a vector of distribution factors, z, the household allocation problem can be represented as

max

U m Lm; Cm; uK + (1 ) U f Lf ; Cf ; uK

8 Lm;Lf ;Cm;Cf ;K;hK m;hK f

<>> Cm + Cf + K = wmhW m + wf hW f + y

s:t:

>>:

Li + hW i + hKi = T; i uK K; hmK ; hKf = uK

=

m; f

(1.1)

where and (1 ) are welfare weights. An interpretation of m = and f = (1 ) is that they represent, respectively, the bargaining power of m and f in the intra-household allocation process, i 0. In a collective model, captures the decision process and can be a function of prices, non-labor income, and distribution factors, y;wm;wf ;z .
The e¢ ciency assumption implies that the solution to the household problem (1.1) is equivalent to a two stage process:
1. Parents agree on:
(a) children’s utility level and the resources directed to produce it. (b) how to allocate the residual non-labor income among themselves.
2. Each parent separately chooses his or her private consumption, subject to his or her corresponding budget constraint.

Let Li wm; wf ; y; z and Ci wm; wf ; y; z , i = m; f , K wm; wf ; y; z and uK wm; wf ; y; z , be the solution of problem (1.1). There is a function wm; wf ; y; z such that each parent solves in the second stage:

max U i Li; Ci; uK
Li ;C i

s:t: wiLi + Ci = wiT + i

(1.2)

The function ( ), known as the sharing rule, achieves the decentralization of the household problem, so i is the fraction of total expenditure on nonpublic goods allocated to parent i. If m wm; wf ; y; z = wm; wf ; y; z , then f wm; wf ; y; z = y

Let V i wi; i; uK be the individual indirect utility of agent i conditional on uK corresponding to the problem (1.2). The optimal choice of the sharing rule and children’s utility can be obtained returning to the …rst stage problem:

The ratio M W P i = @V i=@uK = @V i=@ i is i’s marginal willingness to pay for children’s utility. Condition (1.5) states that the sum of parents’marginal willingness to pay must be equal to the marginal cost of the resources allocated to children’s welfare (M C).

From BCM Proposition 1 if the preferences of both adult members are such that both private expenditures i and children’s utility uK are normal (i.e., an increase

in household non-labor income raises both private and public consumption), an increase

in i’s Pareto weight increases household expenditure on children’s welfare if and only if

In other words, the key aspect is not the comparison

di¤erence in parents’MWP response to a change in shares.

1.4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
1.4 Empirical Application
1.4.1 Parametric Speci…cation

Using the model previously presented, BCM demonstrate that it is possible to recover model structure (individual preferences and Pareto weights) from observed behavior (individual labor supplies and the resources directed to children’s human capital, as functions of wages and non-labor income). In general, it is not possible to recover preferences and the decision process from a reduced-form speci…cation, as di¤erent structural models could have generated the observed behavior. However, BCM show that identi…ability requires 1) the availability of a distribution factor, or 2) that individual consumption and leisure are separable from children’s welfare.

In order to identify the BCM model, a particular parametric form is used, based on CRV, that exploits the two-stage representation to derive the speci…cation. Recurring to the second stage of the household decision process (1.2), the individual indirect utility of agent i conditional on children’s welfare can be represented by means of a functional form of the price-independent generalized logarithmic (PIGLOG) class:5

Note that in this speci…cation, the parameter

on

the

devoted to private consumption. In this case, the distribution factors are not necessary

to keep uK at a particular level while wages and non-labor income varies; the individual

preferences for private and public goods as well as the Pareto weights can be recovered from

variations in wages and non-labor income, since the e¤ect of these changes on children’s utility

production are captured by the sharing rule without a¤ecting labor supplies in other ways

(see subsection 2.3.2). Also, i’s corresponding MWP under this speci…cation is M W P i =

i 2

ln

, so according to BCM Proposition 1, a marginal change in i’s Pareto

weight increases the resources directed to children if and only if

The corresponding leisure demand for each individual is:

The corresponding income elasticity of leisure demand is

Therefore, if leisure is a normal good, it would be a luxury good if i > 0 or a necessity if

Returning to the …rst stage, where the optimal choice of the sharing rule and children’s welfare is obtained, it is assumed that children’s utility has a CES form with constant returns:6

h uK K; hKm; hfK = m(hmK ) + f hKf

i1= + KK ;

X

i > 0;

i = 1;

1 (1.8)

where the cost share of input i (proportion of total expenditure spent on children’s

welfare on input i) is i, and the elasticity of substitution is

=

1 1

.

To take into account

the number of school-age children (NK) in children’s utility production, the function i =

( ) exp ~1i +~2i NK ( ) , 1+exp(~1m+~m 2 NK )+exp ~f1 +~f2 NK

i 2 (0; 1), (i = m; f ) is used in the estimation process, where

~1i and ~i2 are estimated (i = m; f ). This function imposes the condition i > 0, and K is

de…ned as the residual K = 1 m f . The condition 1 is imposed in the estimation

process by the function = 1 exp ( ~), where ~ is estimated.

Solving problem (1.3), parents’ time and expenditure allocations to children’s welfare hmK; hKf ; K are given by:

hKi = K=

i
wi A 1= uK; i = m; f
1 m f A 1= uK

(1.9) (1.10)

where A = ( m) (wm)1 + f wf 1 + 1 m f . Also, the respective expenditure function becomes eK = A1=(1 )uK.
6 The advantage of using the CES function is that it is not necessary to assume in advance the degree of substitution among resources used for the production of children’s utility, parental time, and money spent on them (equal to one if the Cobb Douglas production function is used), allowing the data to determine the degree of substitutability. Initially, CRV (2010) considered a less general function, like the Cobb-Douglas. However, in their forthcoming article, they too have used a CES form.

The system is estimated using the Feasible Generalized Nonlinear Least Squares (FGNLS) estimator. Robust standard errors are used to guard against possible misspeci…cation of the variance matrix.

1.4.2 Data
Estimation of the empirical model speci…ed in the preceding subsection is information-demanding. It requires principally labor market data (the labor supply of individual members and their respective wage rates), the non-labor income of the household, and expenditures and time devoted to children’s education. A survey that satis…es the information requirements is the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS). It is a multithematic and longitudinal survey elaborated by researchers at the Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA) and the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE).
A subsample was extracted from the second wave of the MxFLS (2005-2006) containing only nuclear families with children under 15 years of age, at least one school-age child, and where both parents work. Nuclear families were used to focus on households where the decision process is concentrated in the parents, reducing the possibility of interaction with other kin within the household. Although the cuto¤ at age 15 may seem arbitrary, the analysis concentrated on school-age children (5-14 years) because 1) it is less likely that a child in this age range has bargaining power in household decisions, and 2) the survey only registers children’s educational data in this age range.7 This study thus captures allocation decisions for children who may be attending school through the secondary level.
7 An interesting test of robustness would be separate the sample of households by age levels of children and see if the results are maintained. However, limiting the sample to households with children aged 14 years or less would reduce it to 158 families, and this partition would reduce it even more. Some authors, like Apps and Rees (2009), argue that a child should be considered as a decision maker. This approach may depend on a number of factors (e.g., age, education, occupation, income), exogeneity (are they "molded" by the same parents?), and the stability of children’s preferences (Browning et al. 2011). In the context of the collective model, if a child has bargaining power, we would need data about a private good consumed by the
14

1.4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
There are 8,328 households (34,873 individuals) in the MxFLS-2, of which 3,990 (48.16%) are nuclear families, and 1,380 have only children under 15 years old including at least one school-age child. A sample of 158 was chosen from the subset of families where both parents work and whose records were missing no information. The sample is relatively small; one way to enlarge it would be to include families in which a household member did not participate in the labor market.8 A theoretical and an empirical model that consider the presence of children and non-participation are developed in chapters 2 and 3, respectively.
The time measurement unit is hours per week for those variables related to time allocations. Time devoted to children’s education corresponds to helping children with studies and homework. Leisure time is computed as 112 h/week (16 h/day) less time allocated to market work and children’s education. Children’s educational expenses in the household include enrollment fees, exams, school supplies, uniforms, and transportation.
The measure of the wage rate is average hourly earnings (labor income/hours worked in last year). Non-labor income is average weekly household current income less labor income of parents. The distribution factors z1 and z2 considered in this study are age and education di¤erences between parents, respectively. As mentioned by Quisumbing and Maluccio (2003, p. 288), in the selection of distribution factors (in their case human capital and assets at marriage), "even though they may be endogenous as a result of marriage market selection or correlation with other unobservables, they are clearly exogenous to decisions made within marriage."
Table 1.1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample analyzed. On average, fathers spend more time on market work and mothers on helping children with their studies. There
child in order to identify his or her respective power. We would also need data such as working time, which is collected in the MxFLS-2 survey only if the person is at least 15 years old. An exercise of this kind was done by Dauphin, El Lahga, Fortin, and Lacroix (2011) with data from children aged 16 and over.
8 The recovery of some elements of the decision process in collective models of household labor supply has essentially been based on the observation of the household’s working hours, wages and nonlabor income. In the standard unitary model, the wage of one household member does not a¤ect the labor supply of the other member. However, wages do a¤ect bargaining position within the household in a collective context; in this case, a change in the wage of one member can in‡uence labor supply of his or her partner via the sharing rule of the nonlabor income.
Thus, identi…cation is not initially possible when nonparticipation is considered. However, there have been advances in collective labor supply models that include participation decision without public consumption and household production (Donni 2003; Blundell, Chiappori, Magnac, and Meghir 2007). These studies consider the case where the working hours of the wife vary continously, but they di¤er about the continuity of husband’s labor supply (Donni assumes that it is continuous and Blundell et al. reduce the problem to not working or working full time). In both models, at most one member decides not to participate and the participation decision relies on an explicitly postulated reservation wage accompanied by certain assumptions.

is no signi…cant di¤erence in wage rates. The male is on average the older of the couple, although he has less education than the female; this education di¤erence is not surprising considering that the sample includes only families in which both parents participate in the labor market.

1.4.3 Results
1.4.3.1 Estimation Results

The structural collective model presented in (1.14) is highly nonlinear, so several local minima

were found. The estimation results presented in Table 1.2 correspond to the minimum scaled

RSS found. The estimated parameters are divided into three panels. Panel A contains the

parameters related to parents’preferences (1.6). Leisure is apparently a luxury good for the father since the estimate of f is positive, but it is not estimated precisely for the mother;

CRV (forthcoming) also found that leisure seems to be a luxury good for a sample of Dutch

couples, but in their case for both parents. As is the case in CRV, because

m 2

and

f 2

are statistically di¤erent from zero, the consumption/leisure decision for both parents is

16

1.4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
nonseparable from the resources allocated to children’s welfare. This means that children’s welfare changes have not only an income e¤ect but also a substitution e¤ect on individual decisions such as labor supply. This …nding can serve as an argument for including children in the estimation of a collective model, since their introduction can help avoid rejecting the hypothesis of collective rationality within a household, as mentioned by Fortin and Lacroix (1997).
Panel B contains the parameters related to children’s utility production (1.8). With respect to the coe¢ cients related to the input share i, the …xed part of the share ~i1 is greater for the mother than for the father. In the case of the variable part (~i2), as the number of children increases, other things being equal, the mother’s time participation increases, whereas that of the father decreases. Considering these two estimates, the average cost share of the father is thus always inferior to that of the mother in the production of children’s utility. Additionally, it seems that parental time and expenses on education are imperfect complements in children’s utility production (the elasticity of substitution , although signi…cant, is of low magnitude). In contrast, CRV (forthcoming) found that for their sample of Dutch couples this elasticity is approximately one for an average household.
Finally, the estimated parameters of the mother’s Pareto weight (1.13) are shown in Panel C. All else being equal, the mother’s relative wage has a signi…cantly positive impact on her Pareto weight ( 2), so an increase in her wage could give greater in‡uence to her preferences in household allocation. An increase the mother’s age di¤erence with respect to the father ( 4) seems to have a positive impact on the mother’s power. Non-labor income ( 3) and education di¤erence ( 5) do not seem to have a signi…cant impact on the mother’s power in the sample studied.

1.4.3.2 Changing the Distribution of Power Between Parents: Consequences for Resources Directed Toward Children’s Education
The purpose of this subsection is analyze how a change in parents’ bargaining position is re‡ected in the intrahousehold allocation of resources, with emphasis on allocations made for children’s welfare. Since one goal of this study is to identify from observed behavior how much each parent cares for his or her children in terms of the resources allocated to them, performing this analysis under a collective model that also considers public consumption seems more appropriate than assuming, like other empirical studies, that fathers do not derive utility from their children’s welfare (i.e., that it is a private good for mothers). An incorrect picture of individual preferences and of the intra-household decision process can be obtained if we consider, ex ante, that only the mother is interested in investing in her children. With this in mind, Table 1.3 reports the partial derivatives of the sharing rule (columns 1 and 2) and the elasticities of some variables and functions of the model (columns 3 to 10) with respect to the factors included in the Pareto weight function. Calculations are evaluated for families with two school-age children, at the mean wage across both sexes (about MXN $37 per hour), and sample means of the other covariates; this sets the baseline.
The impact of a marginal change in one variable on the residual non-labor income allocated after expenses to the mother and the father in children’s welfare is provided in columns 1 and 2, respectively. While the non-labor income to share between parents is constant in the case of private goods only, so that there is an exact trade-o¤ between parents’shares, this condition does not have to be ful…lled when public consumption is also considered, as the amount to share varies with the cost of producing children’s utility. In this sense, a MXN $1 increase in the mother’s wage (which is equivalent to a weekly increase of MXN $33 in her labor income, at the mean hours worked by mothers), translates into a transfer of MXN $45 to the production of children’s utility and to the father. Moreover, the transfer amounts to MXN $6 to the father, although this e¤ect is not precisely estimated. A MXN $1 increase in the father’s wage (equivalent to a weekly increase of MXN $47 in his labor income), translates into a transfer of MXN $81, of which MXN $26 are received by the mother. The outcome that i is decreasing in wi is expected in the sense that it is plausible that i’s wage increase does not dramatically improve i’s bargaining position, so that i is not able to keep all the direct gains and to extract in addition a larger fraction of household non-labor income conditional on public expenditures. Also, these results suggest that the fathers in the sample are more concerned about their children than mothers and that they behave in a more altruistic manner toward their partners than the mothers do. The next row indicates that the e¤ect of a MXN $1 increase in household non-labor income
19

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION

on parents’shares is not statistically signi…cant. The impact of the distribution factors on the sharing rule are reported in the next two rows. In general, their e¤ects on the shares are imprecisely estimated at the baseline, although one year more of age di¤erence of the mother with respect to the father induces an additional MXN $22 of income to the mothers.

Columns 3 and 4 show private consumption elasticities for mothers and fathers respectively. At the baseline, both own- and cross-wage elasticities of mothers’ private consumption are positive and statistically signi…cant (0.595 and 0.332, respectively). Fathers’ own-wage elasticity is negative (-0.563) and cross-wage elasticity is positive (0.059), although neither is statistically signi…cant. Both mothers’and fathers’private consumption elasticities with respect to non-labor income are positive (0.026 and 0.024, respectively), but only mothers’elasticity is statistically signi…cant. These results imply that mothers bene…t most from increments of household labor and non-labor income for households in the sample. Distribution factors seem to have a negligible e¤ect on private consumption of both parents.

Columns 5 and 6 present various labor supply elasticities for the mother and father respectively. At the baseline, the own-wage elasticity of mothers’ labor supply is positive and statistically signi…cant: a ten percent increase in her wage would induce an increase of approximately 1.7 percent in the hours of market labor. In contrast, a ten percent increase in her partner’s wage would lead mothers to decrease their worked hours by approximately 3.1 percent. A standard labor supply model could also have accounted for mothers’observed behavior when substitution dominates income e¤ect, but it would not necessarily have explained the e¤ect of fathers’ wages over their supply. Fathers’ own-wage elasticitiy is negative but very small (-0.005) and not statistically signi…cant. This insensibility of the male’s labor supply is commonly found in the literature. His labor supply is more sensitive to a change in the mother’s wage: it would be reduced by 2.8 percent if his partner’s wage increases by ten percent. Overall, the labor supply of the mother is more sensitive with respect to changes in own- and cross- wage rates than the labor supply of the father.

Columns 7 to 9 report elasticities of resources directed to children’s utility production.

When the wage rate of one parent increases, parental time dedicated to children’s education

increases for both parents accompanied by an increase in related expenditure. This is

expected because there is a positive relation between relative wages and bargaining power (i’s

Pareto weight increases with his or her relative wage; see parameter 2), because both parents

obtain utility from their children’s welfare (parameter

i 2

is

negative

for

both

parents),

and because of the complementarity of factors related to children’s utility production (the

magnitude of is relatively low). Therefore, if the bargaining power of one parent increases

20

1.4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
(via an increase in his or her wage), there would be more resources directed to children. However, contrary to the common presumption that mothers care more for children than fathers, implying that an increase in the mother’s power is more bene…cial to children than an increase in the father’s, the wage elasticities calculated in the baseline for resources directed to children’s education are higher for changes in the father’s wage than for the mother’s. If the mother’s wage were increased by ten percent, the mother’s time dedicated to children would increase by 1.7 percent (although the increase is not statistically signi…cant) and both father’s time and expenses would increase by 2.2 percent. If the father’s wage increases the same amount as the mother’s, the mother’s time and expenses would increase by 6 percent and the father’s time by 5.5 percent. From the perspective of the theoretical model, this would indicate that with an increase in the father’s bargaining power equal to that of the mother, his willingness to pay for children’s welfare is more responsive to increases in his resources for private consumption than hers. Consequently, the "amount" of children’s utility uK produced inside the household would be higher with an increase in the father’s wage than in the mother’s. This result is shown in column 10, in which (1.12) is computed in the baseline.
Remembering that parents’ care for their children is understood here as changes in resources directed to children associated with a change in the balance of intrahousehold power, this unforeseen result is the interaction of three components of the structural model: the relative weight of the parents in the household, individual preference and the technology to produce children’s utility. The …rst component, bargaining power, implies that a bene…cial change in the Pareto weight of the mother (or father) results in household allocations more according to her (or his) preferences. Although parents have di¤erent preferences, both obtain utility from their children’s welfare. The …nal component at play, the technology used to produce children’s utility, is a¤ected by two forces in di¤erent directions: a lower use of all factors (because the factors are complementary, an increase in the price of one is associated with a lower use of all) and an increase of expenditures on children (and consequently parental time) via an increase in household labor income.
A change in non-labor income does have a positive impact on the resources directed to children. Because no signi…cant change in parents’ share for private consumption accompanies an increase in household non-labor income, more resources are directed to the production of children’s utility. Indeed, a positive change of ten percent in non-labor income would induce an increase of approximately 1.3 percent of resources directed to children’s utility production. Moreover, as the increase in parents’ time dedicated to children is accompanied by a reduction in both labor supplies, an increase of ten percent in non-labor
21

CHAPTER 1. PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION
income would mean a decrease of aproximately 0.5 percent of both parents’time dedicated to market labor.
Finally, due to its economically negligible in‡uence on the mother’s Pareto weight in the sample studied, the distribution factors of mother’s age and education di¤erence with respect to the father do not have an impact on household market labor and resources directed to children’s utility production.

1.4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
A change in parents’wages and household non-labor income is likely to a¤ect the resources directed to children, simply because these modify the set of possible allocations: they have a direct impact on either preferences or the budget constraint. A clearer understanding of household behavior can be obtained if only there is a change in the distribution of power.9 The following exercise is an analysis of the impact of exogenous changes in Pareto weights on household allocations. According to the theoretical model, a shift in the balance of power between parents could change household outcomes even when the budget set does not change. With this idea in mind, Figure 1.1 presents the e¤ect of an exogenous change in the range of 0 to 10% in favor of one of the parents (or equivalently a change in 1 of approximately 28%) on selected variables in the model. Calculations are for families with two school-age children, at the mean wage for both parents, and for sample means of the other covariates.
Changes in the mother’s Pareto weight in her favor are denoted by the symbol and in the father’s favor by . The upper left panel of the …gure focuses on the change in parents’ share with respect to their shares evaluated at the baseline. The mother’s share responds more than the father’s to changes in the distribution of power. The upper center panel shows the mother’s marginal willingness to pay for children’s utility standardized by the marginal cost of producing it. Therefore, both MWPs must add up to one. At the baseline, mothers have a larger willingness to pay than fathers (M W P f =M C > 0:5), a situation that is maintained with shifts in their bargaining power of around 10%.
The upper right panel illustrates the percentage change in children’s utility. Although mothers have a larger MWP at the baseline than fathers for resources directed to children’s utility production, this feature is not translated into more resources directed to children when mothers’Pareto weight increases; there is instead a reduction in resources. Likewise, a reduction in mothers’Pareto weight is accompanied by an increase in resources directed to children. This outcome is a result of fathers’MWP being more income sensitive than that of mothers. Since both parents have the same wage at the baseline, the di¤erence in the income sensitivity of MWPs depends on which parent has the lowest parameter ^i2, with the fathers’being more negative than that of the mothers.
The lower panels focus on outcomes for both parents in the individual domain, calculated as percentage change in the three panels. The lower left panel shows private expenditures,
9 This is the idea behind the introduction of distibution factors to the collective approach. The additional information obtained in this manner leads to greater restrictions on the set of e¢ cient possible allocations. As an example, for any given level of household non-labor income, individual contributions can only in‡uence household outcomes through the decision process. However, since it is not possible to adequately establish the identity of individual non-labor income in the MxFLS-2, the use of this distribution factor was not possible in this study.

the lower center panel focuses on leisure, and the lower right displays labor supply. The bene…ciary of greater bargaining power enjoys an increase in both private expenditure and leisure as a consequence of the increase in his or her share, while the other member’s consumption is reduced. Nevertheless, the e¤ect of the mothers’ private expenditure is larger than that of the fathers’, and in the case of leisure, the fathers’e¤ect is larger than that of the mothers. Regarding labor supply, one member’s increased power is related to a reduction in their hours o¤ered to the labor market and an increase in the hours o¤ered by their partner.

1.5 Final Remarks
A consensus has been developed that households do not behave as a singular entity, but that the behavior of each individual member should be considered as well. It is important to understand better how household decisions are made in order to enhance the e¤ectiveness of targeting individual members.
The collective model has emerged as a more appropriate framework for analyzing household behavior. Under this approach, resources invested in children’s welfare depend not only on the household budget constraint but also on the parents’individual preferences and their relative position in the decision making. This chapter employs an empirical application for the collective theoretical model of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005). In the model, both parents derive utility from the production of children’s utility by means of a public good and their time. The empirical analysis shows how household allocations respond to changes in the balance of power between the couple, particularly with respect to resources directed toward children’s education.
The model is applied to a sample of Mexican nuclear families from the MxFLS-2, and focuses on couples in which both work, have only children under 15 years, at least one of school age. Based on Cherchye, de Rock, and Vermeulen (2010), the estimation strategy takes advantage of the two-stage representation of the collective model to construct a ‡exible functional speci…cation for the observables.
The estimation results highlight some interesting …ndings for this particular sample. In the production of children’s utility by means of resources used in their education, parental time and expenditure are complementary inputs, so it is not entirely possible to substitute time for expenditure or time between parents to augment children’s wellbeing. Also, the distribution of bargaining power depends signi…cantly on the mother’s relative wage and age di¤erence with respect to the father. Finally, parents’ preferences are not separable from resources directed to children’s welfare.
In order to analyze whether a change in the decision process between parents a¤ects resources directed to children’s welfare, some elasticities are calculated with respect to factors that in‡uence the decision process (as represented by Pareto weights). For families with characteristics at the sample average, no evidence was found that mothers care more for their children than fathers. Other things being equal, there are more resources directed to children’s education when a father has more power via his relative wage. This …nding is in
28

1.5. FINAL REMARKS
line with the results of Cherchye et al. (2010) and complements existing literature that has found that the fraction of household non-labor income received by each parent a¤ects the resources directed to children (such as Thomas 1990, and Lundberg et al. 1997).
Since the set of options available for household allocations changes with wages and non-labor income, a clearer picture of the e¤ect of a change in the balance of power between parents can be obtained if there is an exogenous change in the decision process that keeps the household budget constraint unchanged. To this end, graphical illustrations are provided of an exogenous change in mothers’Pareto weight at the baseline. Although mothers have a larger marginal willingness to pay for children’s utility than fathers, it is only when fathers’ power increases, and not when mothers have more power, that more resources are directed to children’s utility production.
In the case of Mexico, this result complements the evidence supplied by Bobonis (2009) for a sample of rural households, where changes in female non-labor income (from the conditional cash transfer Progresa/Oportunidades) boost the share of expenditures on children’s clothing and education, and where changes in household income not exclusive to the female partner (such as variations in rainfall shocks) have a lesser in‡uence on this share. The distinct pattern found in this chapter can be partly explained by the pro…le of households analyzed; as Bobonis has mentioned, gender inequality in familial relations is very common in rural Mexico; social norms induce to direct most part of female partner’s income to public consumption. If we consider not only rural, low-income households, the pressure of social norms on the distribution of women’s private and public consumption could be weaker, especially where they have more education and participate actively in the labor market.
The results discussed here highlight the danger of assumptions in policy design about which household member cares more for children; instead, a more complete knowledge of internal dynamics between household members could improve the e¤ectiveness of this type of targeted policy. It may be that for the particular characteristics and economic environment of families under a conditional cash transfer program such as Progresa/Oportunidades, it is appropriate to give the additional income to the mother, but if we consider the more diverse types of households analyzed in this sample, the intended policy outcomes may not be met.

Children and Non-Participation in a Model of Collective Household Labor Supply
2.1 Introduction
The collective approach, unlike the unitary one, provides an adequate theoretical background for analyzing intra-household allocations: how individual preferences and the decision process can be recovered from household members’aggregate behavior. This model draws upon the idea that an increase in the decision power of one household member changes household behavior in his or her favor, even though total household resources are kept constant. In this sense, the collective approach can be used to analyze the targeting of programs. This is the case for conditional cash transfer (CCT) public programs, in which a household receives a monetary compensation for the ful…llment of certain requirements that are positively related to household welfare. The goal of many such programs is to foster the human capital of children. However, some programs give the cash transfer to a particular household member (generally the mother1) instead of the intended recipient (children). Therefore, the impact of the cash transfer on a child’s consumption depends on how the intra-household allocation processes distribute this additional income; it could might enhance or diminish a child’s consumption. For example, Bobonis (2009), using data from the evaluation of Mexican
1 Examples of CCT programs that gives the transfer preferably to the mother (or female household head) are: Bono de Desarrollo Humano (Ecuador), Chile Solidario (Chile), Familias en Acción (Colombia), Progresa-Oportunidades (Mexico), Programa de Asistencia Familiar - PRAF (Honduras), Red de Protección Social - RPS (Nicaragua).

Progresa/Oportunidades program, found that the increase in female non-labor income from participating in the program increases the share of expenditures on children’s goods. These programs could also in‡uence other household outcomes, such as the labor status of the cash transfer receiver.
The labor supply model of Chiappori (1992) has been used extensively for empirical applications (see, for example, Fortin and Lacroix 1997, Canada; Chiappori, Fortin, and Lacroix 2002, the USA); however, this framework considers the simplest possible case of household structure (childless households with two working members), making it di¢ cult to apply the collective approach to the broader de…nition of household typically found in developing countries: a two-adult household with a non-working female partner and at least one child. The contribution of this chapter is to generalize Chiappori’s (1992) model to incorporate both the presence of children and the decision to participate in the labor market, providing the necessary theoretical considerations for an empirical application, to be applied to Mexican data in chapter 3. The model employs the method of Donni (2003) with the scenario of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005), taking into account the presence of children in a household, to address the possibility of non-participation.
The proposed model generalizes the identi…cation results of Chiappori (1992); individual preferences and the sharing rule can be recovered from observed behavior. Identi…cation requires the knowledge of a distribution factor and the existence of a unique reservation wage for each adult household member at which both members are indi¤erent as to whether a member participates in the labor market or not. In contexts where children and a non-working partner are elements of a household, empirical applications of the model should increase the sample size and reduce related selection bias. Also, the model can be used to analyze the impact of CCT on expenditures on children and on household members’labor supplies.2
2.1.1 The Collective Approach
Given that a household’s demand for goods and the labor supply of its members can be obtained from household survey data, what can be said about the structural components of the decision process that lead to this household behavior? The traditional unitary approach, with its ad hoc assumptions that aggregate individual preferences, considers a household as a
2 For example, this could be an interesting form to complement Bobonis (2009)’s …nding. Since in the Progresa-Oportunidades sample used there is a low female participation in the labor market, under this model can be also analyzed the impact of this CCT on female’s time dedicated to the labor market.
32

2.1. INTRODUCTION
single decision-making unit, leaving unexplained how the household reaches its agreement to allocate resources. Furthermore, the lack of a distinction between individual and household preferences in this approach is unsatisfactory from the perspective of welfare analysis.3 The framework imposes an empirical straitjacket on public policy analysis with an individual targeting emphasis, since price changes are the only tool available for intra-household reallocations (Quisumbing and McCla¤erty 2006). The approach has also been criticized for a lack of empirical support of its theoretical implications, such as the consideration of total income but not its source in household consumption decisions (i.e., household members pool their income),4 and the assumption that cross-price substitution e¤ects are symmetric (e.g., the compensated wage changes of spouses have the same e¤ect on each other’s labor supply).5
Alternative approaches, such as non-cooperative and cooperative (or collective) models, have tried to take into account the multiplicity and heterogeneity of decision makers in a household.6 On the one hand, in the absence of binding and enforceable agreements between household members, non-cooperative models have assumed that household members maximize their utility subject to an individual budget constraint and taking as given each other’s behavior. However, the intra-household allocations under this framework are not necessarily Pareto e¢ cient; if we consider deviations of the equilibrium outcome, it is possible to increase the welfare of one household member without reducing that of others. In a household context this result is not very satisfactory, since possibilities for Pareto improvements may arise from daily interaction among their members. On the other hand, the only assumption that household collective models have in common is that household decisions
3 Neverthless, using a strategy that provides more structure to the household allocation problem or that uses more extensive data, it is possible in this framework to do welfare analysis at the individual level (Donni 2008a).
4 For the rejection of the income pooling hypothesis see, among others, Thomas (1990); Bourguignon, Browning, Chiappori, and Lechene (1993); Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori, and Lechene (1994); Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997); and Fortin and Lacroix (1997).
5 For the rejection of the symmetry of the Slutsky matrix see, among others, Browning and Meghir (1991); Blundell, Pashardes, and Weber (1993); Fortin and Lacroix (1997); and Browning and Chiappori (1998).
6 Some unitary models propose ways to incorporate multiple individuals in the analysis. Samuelson (1956) considers that a household could act as one individual if its members agree on how to aggregate their preferences; as a result they choose to maximize a social welfare function. By the “rotten-kid theorem,” Becker (1974; 1991) arrives at a household objective function that converges to the preferences of the “altruistic head” of the household. Suppose that a household consist of two members: an altruistic head and a sel…sh member. Trying to avoid retaliation from the head, the other individual would not attempt to increase his or her consumption (be rotten) at the expense of the head’s consumption. However, these e¤orts are based on strong assumptions (Bergstrom 1989; Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997) and their “outcomes are empirically indistinguishable from those of constrained individual utility maximization” (McElroy and Horney 1981, 333).
33

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
are Pareto e¢ cient,7 so it is not necessary to specify the actual process that determines the intra-household allocation on the e¢ ciency frontier, only to assume that it exists.
E¢ ciency means that household allocations are optimal; no other consumption bundle could provide more utility for household members at the same cost. In this sense, an equivalent interpretation of Pareto e¢ ciency is that household members initially reach an agreement on the respective amount each is allowed to spend, a "sharing rule." Then, all members independently choose their consumption, subject to their respective share. The approach does not impose a particular form on the rule; it only requires that it exists.
While assuming that e¢ ciency of household decisions reduces the set of possible allocations, there could exist a continuum of di¤erent structural models that generate the same observable behavior (Chiappori and Ekeland 2009). It is in this sense that particular hypotheses over goods or preferences have been made within the collective framework to recover preferences and decision making from household aggregate demand. The main identi…cation results have been made for the case where all goods consumed in a household are private (i.e., they are consumed non-jointly and exclusively by each member); where one member’s consumption does not have a direct e¤ect on another member’s wellbeing; and at an interior solution for household demands. Intuitively, the quantities consumed by each member are a guide to the intra-household bargaining power distribution: the consumption of a good associated with a particular individual will be greater as his or her decision power increases.
Applying the collective framework to the case of household labor supply, the seminal collective model proposed by Chiappori (1988; 1992) allows, under certain assumptions, the recovery of some elements of the decision process from the observed labor supply of household members. Since these results are derived from the simplest possible case, empirical applications based on this model have been used as an observation unit: childless households composed of two adult members who participate in the labor market. However, estimates obtained from this type of sample could be imprecise due to small sample size and may be subject to selection biases if households with positive hours of work for their members are the only ones considered (Fortin and Lacroix 1997).
7 This Pareto e¢ ciency assumption can be justi…ed if all household members are aware of the preferences and actions of the others (i.e., there is symmetric information, possibly due to proximity and durability of the household), so they can decide to cooperate to make everyone better o¤ by means of a binding agreement. Alternatively, this agreement can emerge if the relations between household members can be represented as a repeated game. For a more detailed discussion about assuming e¢ ciency see Browning, Chiappori, and Weiss (2011).
34

2.2. LABOR MARKET PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC GOODS
To properly assess the collective framework as a useful tool for welfare evaluation and policy analysis on an intra-household level, it is necessary not to limit the analysis to childless households with members who participate in the labor market. The objective of this chapter is to develop a collective theoretical framework that simultaneously takes into account the presence of children and the decision to participate in the labor market.
Although the chapter is essentially theoretical, it relies on empirically testable restrictions on household labor supply and obtaining information about aspects of the intra-household decision process that can be used for individual welfare analysis and policy evaluation. Indeed, analysis using the collective approach would have limited empirical content if its concepts could not be recovered from observed behavior. For example, the proposed model provides an adequate framework for the analysis of a social program targeted at a particular household member (say, a female member). If the policy increased women’s in‡uence in the household decision process, what would be the impact on household demand? In particular, what would the impact be on household expenditures on children? Could it be that this female "empowerment" would also lead to women’s non-participation in the labor market, or could it be the case that women put so much emphasis on spending on children that they decide to work more hours when they have more power?
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.2 discusses the current literature on collective household labor supply models that includes the possibility of labor force participation and public consumption (like expenses on children). Section 2.3 presents the theoretical framework that incorporates both the decision to participate in the labor market and public goods consumption. Using Donni’s (2003) approach, the possibility of non-participation is introduced in the framework of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005), where parents care about children’s welfare. When children are present in a household, the main conclusions of Chiappori (1992) can be extended: individual preferences and the (conditional) sharing rule can be recovered if one or both of the couple works. Furthermore, individual labor supplies have to satisfy certain testable restrictions. Some …nal remarks are made in section 2.4.
2.2 Labor Market Participation and Public Goods
One application that has been analyzed to a great extent in the collective literature is the household member’s supply of positive hours of work with private consumption. However, this setting is too simple to describe other household compositions and dynamics that are
35

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
observed in real life. When labor market participation and public goods are considered under a collective framework, there are certain aspects to take into account. First, the non-participation decision in the labor market may have an in‡uence on outcomes even for individuals who are not directly a¤ected by this decision. If a member’s threat point involves participation in the labor market (e.g., because a woman’s or man’s participation involves credible outside options for her or him), (potential) wages could a¤ect bargaining positions within a household. This result is the opposite of the one obtained within the unitary model, where potential wages of non-working members are independent of household allocations (only wages of working members matter, due to their e¤ect on budget opportunities). Second, children are likely to be an important source of preference interdependence between parents, since it is reasonable to think that both parents could derive utility from their children’s well-being (although not necessary to the same degree). Furthermore, the presence of children could generate non-separabilities in parents’commodity demand and labor supply (child care, say, may a¤ect the tradeo¤ between consumption and labor force participation and hours of work at the individual level). Finally, household production could assume more relevance when children are present.
Some advances have been made in the literature to include the possibility of participation and public consumption in the collective model (i.e., goods from which both spouses derive utility, such as the amount spent on children, consumed jointly and non-exclusively by each member) but in separate branches. Donni (2003) and Blundell, Chiappori, Magnac, and Meghir (2007) have constructed theoretical frameworks to consider non-participation in the labor market. The former assumes that in a two-adult household, both members can freely choose their working hours, while the latter assume that one of the members can only decide whether to participate or not.
Donni’s work extends the results of Chiappori (1988; 1992), who implicitly considered identi…cation in the two adult members’participation set, to also take into account the case in which one of the two members does not work. To date, the only empirical application of Donni’s framework has been made by Bloemen (2010, Netherlands). The work of Blundell et al. is distinct from Chiappori’s model, since the choice sets are di¤erent (two positive continuous labor supplies versus one discrete and another non-negative continuous labor supply). Donni (2007) develops a model similar to that of Blundell et al.; they di¤er in that the former …xes the male household member’s labor supply at full-time instead of allowing a choice between working full-time or not at all. Structural elements of the decision process can be identi…ed from Donni’s model if the female household member’s labor supply is observed together with at least one household commodity demand.
36

2.2. LABOR MARKET PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC GOODS
The participation decision is included in the standard unitary model by means of a reservation wage, at which an agent is indi¤erent between working and not working. In translating this concept to the collective framework, the central assumption of Pareto e¢ ciency of the household decision process requires that if one member (say, the wife) is indi¤erent between working and not working, the other one (say, the husband) must be indi¤erent as well about the participation decision of the …rst member (Blundell et al. 2007 called this condition the "double indi¤erence" assumption8). Therefore, the participation decision in these two collective models relies on explicitly postulating a reservation wage. Individual preferences and the sharing rule can be recovered for both models.
On the other hand, Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005, hereafter BCM) introduce children into Chiappori’s (1988; 1992) model, assuming that both parents care about their children’s welfare (or equivalently, considering that the expenditure on their children is a public good for them). In general, the decision process cannot be recovered; a continuum of di¤erent structural models can generate the reduced form of each individual’s labor supply and expenditure on children. This result is due to the fact that the level of public consumption in‡uences the analysis of labor supply not only through an income e¤ect but also through its impact on the individual consumption/leisure trade-o¤. Under this approach, identi…ability of the intra-household decision-making process can thus be obtained in two cases: a) where private consumption is separable from expenditures on children, so that the consumption/leisure trade-o¤ e¤ect disappears; or b) by introducing a distribution factor (i.e., a variable that a¤ects the decision process but not the individual preferences or the joint budget set, controlled for total income), allowing for expenditures on children to be kept constant. Empirical applications of the BCM model have been made by Cherchye, de Rock, and Vermeulen (forthcoming, Netherlands) and also in chapter 1 (using Mexican data).
The aim of the present chapter is to model the decision to participate in the labor market in a single collective framework that considers expenditures on children as a public good. The model simultaneously takes into account the possibility that (potential) wages a¤ect the bargaining positions of household members, that the utility of each adult member depends on their children’s wellbeing, and that individual consumption and labor supply decisions are not separable from expenditure on children. Under these assumptions, the underlying
8 To see why, Blundell et al. used the following example. Assume that at a wage in…nitesimally below the reservation wage of a husband, he is indi¤erent between working and not working but that his wife experiences a strict loss if he is not working. Now suppose that at the reservation wage he decides to work and he receives " more to spend on his private consumption than initially agreed. He is better o¤ since he is indi¤erent between participating or not and his consumption increases (if the goods consumed are normal). If " is small enough, the wife is better o¤ too, since the participation of her spouse compensates her more than the reduction in her private consumption.
37

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
structure (individual preferences and the decision process) can be recovered from observed household behavior. The model extends the results of Chiappori (1992) to a more general context that the one considered in the previous literature. An empirical application of this model appears in chapter 3.
2.3 The Framework
The model incorporates the decision to participate in the labor market in BCM’s (2005) framework of household labor supply with expenditures on children. Subsection 2.3.1 presents the main assumptions of the model. Besides the assumptions of individualism and Pareto-e¢ ciency common to the collective approach, the model assumes that both adult household members care about their own consumption (they have egoistic preferences), but that they also care about their children. Subsection 2.3.2 shows a decentralization procedure of the e¢ cient household allocation within this context. As with the case considering only private consumption, the decision process can be represented as operating in two phases by the existence of a sharing rule conditional on the residual non-labor income after the public good purchase. Subsection 2.3.3 shows how the model determines the level of expenditures on children. Here, the framework also addresses the e¤ect of intrahousehold redistribution of power (for example a given policy that "empowers" a speci…c member of the household, such as the mother) regarding household expenditures on children. Subsection 2.3.4 introduces additional assumptions to guarantee the existence of a unique reservation wage for each partner that is consistent with the Pareto-e¢ ciency assumption. The model employs the method used by Donni (2003) to achieve this aim. Finally, subsection 2.3.5 discusses the identi…cation of the model and the corresponding restrictions on household labor supply. Given a set of (potential) wages, non-labor income, and a distribution factor, the framework can recover individual preferences and the conditional sharing rule if one or both partners works.

and domestic production is not considered.9 A Hicksian composite good C is consumed by the household. This good is used for private Cm; Cf and public (K) consumption, with prices set to one (the identi…ability results of the model do not require price variation). In a very general sense, the notion of public consumption should be understood here as any expenditure that increases the utility of both partners, such as expenditures on heating, electricity, housecleaning, among others. A typical example of K, by its normative implications, is the amount spent on children by the household. Non-labor income is denoted by Y .
Each spouse’s utility can be written as:
U i = U i 1 hi; Ci; K ; i = m; f

where U i is strongly quasi-concave, in…nitely di¤erentiable, and strictly increasing in all its arguments. It is also assumed that limhi!1 @U i=@hi = limCi!0 @U i=@Ci = limK!0 @U i=@K = 1, i = m; f . These conditions rule out cases where leisure, and individual and public consumption, are equal to zero; both members consume strictly positive quantities of these goods. These conditions seem reasonable since leisure is arbitrarily de…ned and consumption is aggregated.
It is assumed that household decisions generate Pareto-e¢ cient outcomes, whatever the mechanism used to reach this agreement. Therefore, there is a function such that household allocations hm ; hf ; Cm ; Cf ; K are the solutions to the program:

max

U m (1 hm; Cm; K) + (1

The Pareto weight re‡ects the relative power of m in the household and (1 ) that
of f , in the sense that a larger corresponds to a larger weight of m’s preferences in the
9 The model assumes implicitly that all non-market time corresponds to leisure; it does not consider the division of labor between household and market production. The seminal model of Chiappori (1992) is extended to consider domestic production by Apps and Rees (1997); Chiappori (1997); and Donni (2008b). Empirical applications have been made by Apps and Rees (1996, Australia); Donni and Matteazzi (2010b, the USA); and Rapoport, Sofer, and Solaz (2011, France), among others. A model that considers that the domestic good is public is developed and estimated with British data by Couprie (2007); and van Klaveren, van Praag, and Maassen van den Brink (2008). Under the collective models with domestic production, that of Donni and Matteazzi (2010a) is the only one that considers non-participation. A model that jointly considers non-participation, children, and household production has not been developed yet.

household allocation problem, favoring the outcomes enjoyed by m (and likewise that a smaller corresponds to a lesser weight of those preferences, favoring the outcomes of f ). It is assumed that 2 [0; 1] is a continuously di¤erentiable function of wages and non-labor income, as well as at least one distribution factor z, i.e., = wm; wf ; Y; z .
A few assumptions should be made explicit here. First, it is assumed that the bundle wf ; wm; Y; z varies within a compact subset K of R3+ R. Second, it is assumed that hm, hf , C, and K are observed (as functions of wm, wf , Y , and z), whereas the individual consumptions Cm and Cf are unobserved. In general, household surveys do not collect information about intrahousehold allocation of expenditures but about aggregate consumption C at the household level. Third, it is assumed that both partners’ wages are always observed by the econometrician, even when a partner does not participate in the labor market. In practice, it is possible to calculate a potential wage for the non-participating member by means of an auxiliary equation (see subsection 3.3.3 for an example of this type of procedure for imputing wages).
2.3.2 The Conditional Sharing Rule
The solution to the household program (2.1) can be thought of as a two-stage process: 1) the couple agrees on the level of the public expenditure and how to distribute the resulting residual non-labor income between them; and 2) conditional on the outcome of the …rst stage, the couple decide, independently of each other, their individual consumption and labor supply. Formally, let hm wm; wf ; Y; z , hf wm; wf ; Y; z , Cm wm; wf ; Y; z , Cf wm; wf ; Y; z , and K wm; wf ; Y; z be the solution of program (2.1); then a function
i exists such that:
Ci wm; wf ; Y; z = i wm; wf ; Y; z + wihi wm; wf ; Y; z ; i = m; f
Here m and f characterize the conditional sharing rule,10 the portion of non-labor income allocated to each member once spending on the public good has been discounted:
m wm; wf; Y; z + f wm; wf; Y; z = Y K wm; wf; Y; z
10 When private goods are considered together with public goods, the (conditional) sharing rule is implied by e¢ ciency, but in this case it is not equivalent to e¢ ciency for a particular level of public expenditure. The level of public consumption depends also on the allocation of private consumption and labor supply, a fact that cannot be isolated completely with the two-stage process interpretation of the household problem (see BCM 2005).
40

2.3. THE FRAMEWORK
Note that i can be positive or negative; they could agree to spend beyond their non-labor income on the public good, and transfers between the two are also possible.

Fixing K = K wm; wf ; Y; z , the second stage of the household program (2.1), can be represented as:

max U i 1 hi; Ci; K
hi ;C i

s:t: Ci = wihi + i;

i = m; f

(2.2)

with hi wm; wf ; Y; z and Ci wm; wf ; Y; z as interior solutions to the individual problem. The structure of both partners’labor supplies can be described by:

hm wm; wf ; Y; z = Hm wm; wm; wf ; Y; z

hf wm; wf ; Y; z = Hf wf ; Y K

wm; wf; Y; z

where = m, and when is …xed, Hm and Hf are Marshallian labor supply functions. With the idea of expressing labor supplies in terms of public expenditures (K) and maintaining the assumption that K is …xed, the following process is used. Let O be some open subset of K such that @K=@z does not vanish on O. The condition K wm; wf ; Y; z = K is used to express z as a function of wm; wf ; Y; K by the implicit function theorem. Following from this construction, the couple’s labor supplies are:

h~m wm; wf ; Y; K h~f wm; wf ; Y; K

= Hm wm; wm; wf; Y; wm; wf; Y; K

= Hf wf; Y K

wm; wf; Y; wm; wf; Y; K

(2.3) (2.4)

In this way, i’s labor supply is described as a function of wages, non-labor income, and a distribution factor z such that public expenditures are exactly K. Hence, the values of wm, wf , and Y are not constrained to assure that K wm; wf ; Y; z = K; the key role of z is to guarantee that the level of public expenditure is exactly K. This structure generates testable restrictions because the same function wm; wf ; Y; z enters each member’s labor supply (see footnote 13).

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
2.3.3 The Determination of Public Expenditures
The Bowen-Lindahl-Samuelson condition characterizes e¢ ciency for public good expenditures. Formally, the …rst-order conditions for household program (2.1), with an interior solution for individual and public consumption, give:
@U m=@K @U f =@K @U m=@C + @U f =@C = 1
Equivalently, this condition can be expressed in terms of individual indirect utilities. First, let V i (wi; i; K) denote the value of the second stage of the household program (2.2) for member i:

V i wi; i; K = max U i 1 hi; Ci; K s:t: Ci = wihi + i;
hi ;C i

i = m; f

V i is called the indirect conditional utility because it is the maximum utility that i can achieve, given his or her wage and conditional on the outcomes ( i; K) of the …rst stage decision. Next, returning to the …rst stage, e¢ ciency leads to the following program:

max V m (wm; m; K) + (1 ) V f wf ; f ; K s:t: m + f + K = Y
m; f ;K

The …rst order conditions give: @V m @ m = (1

@V f

@V m

) @ f = @K + (1

@V f )
@K

Therefore:

@V m=@K @V f =@K @V m=@ m + @V f =@ f = 1

(2.5)

The

ratio

@V i=@K @V i=@ i

is

i’s

marginal

willingness

to

pay

(MWP)

for

the

public

good,

in

this

case children. Thus the condition (2.5) states that individual MWPs (or Lindahl prices)

must add up to the market price of expenditure on children. From BCM’s Proposition 1, it

is possible to state that if i’s preferences are such that both public and private consumption

increase with non-labor income (i.e., K and i are normal "goods", so i’s MWP is decreasing

42

2.3. THE FRAMEWORK
in K and increasing in i), a marginal increase in i’s Pareto weight increases the household’s expenditure on children if and only if i’s MWP is more sensitive to changes in his or her share than that of the other member. That is, a marginal increase in m’s power will increase the amount spent on children if and only if m’s MWP is more income sensitive that that of f , and vice versa. Because a positive transfer from one member to the other decreases the MWP for the public good of the transferer and increases the MWP of the transferee, this proposition establishes when the e¤ect on the transferee is more than su¢ cient to compensate the reduction to the transferer. Hence, the key property for analyzing changes in the distribution of power within a household is not the magnitude of the MWPs (say, who cares more for children), but how the MWPs respond to changes in individual resources for private consumption.
Intuitively, empowering one household partner (say, the woman) comes with a higher fraction of household non-labor income for her. If both private and public goods are normal, she will consume more of all commodities, and, conversely, the male partner will see his share and consumption reduced. The question is when the reduction in household expenditures on the public good that comes from the male’s share will be more than compensated by the increase to the female’s share. The answer is when the female partner is more sensitive to changes in her share than her partner, whether she is willing to spend on children a larger fraction than her partner of the additional monetary unit that comes via her empowerment.

2.3.4 The Participation Decision

The standard unitary framework deals with the participation decision of an agent by means of the de…nition of a reservation wage. At this wage, the agent is indi¤erent between working and not working. A reasonable generalization of this de…nition under a collective model with two adult members is that at the reservation wage of one household member, not only that member is indi¤erent between working and not working, but also that the other member is indi¤erent (Blundell et al. 2007).

To characterize the participation decision of a household member, a procedure similar to

the one used by Neary and Roberts (1980) is employed to model household behavior under

rationing, or more generally of quantity constraints, which is characterized in terms of its

unconstrained behavior when faced with shadow prices. The reservation wage of i ($i) is

de…ned by:

$i = Uhii 1; i; K UCi i 1; i;K

43

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
where the notation fx stands for the partial derivative of function f with respect to variable x (here f = U i and x = hi; Ci). This equation is the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and private consumption computed along the axis hi = 0 for a given sharing rule i (and equal to Ci) and a level of public expenditures equal to K.
To concentrate on the second stage of the household problem (2.1), particularly on labor supply decisions, public expenditures are …xed at some arbitrary level K. In this way, the problem is basically reduced to that considered by Donni (2003), in which the participation decision is analyzed in a framework with only private goods. As above, let O be some open subset of K such that @K=@z does not vanish on O, and impose the condition K wm; wf ; Y; z = K, where the latter is equivalent, by the implicit function theorem, to z = wm; wf ; Y; K . Let y = Y K denote the portion of non-labor income not devoted to public expenditures which could be positive or negative (labor income can also be used for public consumption). Therefore, if $i is a function of wm; wf ; Y; K , it can be expressed for notational simplicity as $i wm; wf ; y . Then, i’s reservation wage is implicitly de…ned as a function of wm; wf ; y :

wi = $i wm; wf; Y; wm; wf; Y; K = $i wm; wf; Y; K = $i wm; wf; y

(2.6)

Without additional assumptions, equation (2.6) could have several solutions, i.e., the uniqueness of a reservation wage for member i has to be explicitly postulated under the collective framework. Intuitively, there are two reasons to explain why there can be many wage rates for which i is indi¤erent between working and not working. The …rst comes from the assumption that the sharing rule i depends on i’s wage, so there could be more than one combination of wi and i at which i is indi¤erent. The second is related to the possibility that the sharing rule itself may depend on the non-participation of household members. As shown later, the existence of a well-behaved participation frontier is needed to recover the decision process when one member of the couple does not participate in the labor market. A su¢ cient condition to obtain a unique reservation wage (…xed point) for each member is to de…ne that the function $i is a contraction mapping.
Assumption R. For any wm ; wf ; y and wmo; wfo; y 2 R+2 R, preferences and the sharing rule are such that there is some non-negative real number r < 1 for which the
44

2.3. THE FRAMEWORK

following condition is satis…ed:

max $i wm ; wf ; y
i=m;f

$i wmo ; wfo ; y

r max wi wio
i=m;f

Two remarks can be made at this point. First, this condition does not a¤ect the level of public expenditure; z varies to guarantee that public expenditure is exactly K. Consequently, the distribution factor allows that wm, wf , and Y –and thus also $i– can vary freely, whereas K is kept constant. Second, the assumption only holds in the neighborhood of the participation frontier; in the interior of other household participation sets the allocation of additional income stemming from the participation of one member could be more complex.

In essence, Assumption R restricts the impact on both individual shares (and hence individual consumption) of a change in one household member’s wage. This amounts to assuming that the Pareto weights are smooth functions of both wages and non-labor income, and therefore that the smoothness of the individual utilities is preserved at the participation frontier of each individual.11

Assumption R is not expected to be very restrictive and it simpli…es the analysis by not
having to use more restrictive …xed point theorems to ensure the existence of a well-behaved
participation frontier. Under this assumption, the system of equations $m and $f is a
contraction with respect to wm and wf for any y. Using the Banach contraction principle,12
two corollaries of this assumption are:
1. For any y, the functions $m and $f have a unique …xed point. Then, there exists a
unique pair of wages, w^m (y) and w^f (y), such that both adult members are indi¤erent
between working and not working.
11 In order to understand in greater detail the intuition behind Assumption R, the e¤ect on m’s private consumption will be analyzed at m’s participation frontier …rst when there is an in…nitesimal increase in m’s wage, and second when there is an in…nitesimal increase in f ’s wage. When m’s wage increases, the magnitude of the increase in m’s private consumption depends on whether m is participating or not. When m is not participating, an increase in m’s wage probably has a positive impact on m’s bargaining power, and both m’s reservation wage and consumption share increase. When m is participating, an increase in m’s wage also has a positive e¤ect on household income, and m’s consumption share increases more.
When f ’s wage increases, the e¤ect on m’s private consumption depends also on whether f is participating or not. When f is not participating, the increase in f ’s wage reduce m’s bargaining power. Since the sharing rule re‡ects the distribution of power between household members, if individual leisure is a normal good, it is expected that the decrease of m’s share is associated with a reduction in m’s reservation wage. When f is participating, an increase in f ’s wage also has a positive e¤ect on household income, which may compensate m’s share for the increase in f ’s bargaining power.
Then, the condition that the di¤erence in m’s reservation wage can not be greater in absolute value than the initial increase in m (f )’s wage is satis…ed when m’s consumption share responds less, in absolute value, to changes on m (f )’s wage when m (f ) is not participating than when m (f ) is participating.
12 See Green and Heller (1981) for a de…nition of contraction and of the Banach contraction principle (contraction mapping theorem).

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
2. For any wj (j =6 i) and y, each $i has a unique …xed point with respect to wi. Then, there exists a function i (wj; y) such that member i participates in the labor market if and only if wi > i (wj; y), i = m; f .
Considering the possible interactions of household members’participation decision, four connected sets can then be de…ned:
Participation set (P ): The set of wm; wf ; y is such that both household members choose to work. f ’s non-participation set (N f ): The set of wm; wf ; y is such that f chooses not to work and m chooses to work. m’s non-participation set (N m): The inverse of N f . Non-participation set (N ): The set of wm; wf ; y is such that both household members choose not to work.
2.3.5 Identi…cation
This section discusses the empirical restrictions on each household member’s labor supply implied by the collective setting with children and non-participation. Also, it shows that is possible to recover the structural model (preferences and the sharing rule) simply by observing the labor supplies and the household expenditure on children.
The non-participation set N is not taken into account in identifying individual utilities and the decision process, given the lack of information for this purpose (if the hours of work for both partners are zero, the sharing rule within the household cannot be deduced from the labor supply of both individuals, so individual utilities cannot be recovered). Therefore, it is assumed that at least one of the partners’supplies is an interior solution to (2.1). The following theorem establishes the identi…cation and testability results.
Theorem 1. Let h~m;h~f be a pair of labor supplies, satisfying the regularity conditions listed in Lemmas 1-3 (below). Under Assumption R:
1. Both labor supplies have to satisfy some testable restrictions in the form of partial equations on the participation set P .
46

2.3. THE FRAMEWORK
2. Individual preferences and the sharing rule are identi…ed up to some additive constant D K when at least one of the partners works. Moreover, for each choice of D K , preferences are exactly identi…ed.
The proof of this theorem is developed in the next subsections. First, subsection 2.3.5.1 identi…es the sharing rule in the participation set in which both household members choose to work (P ). The knowledge of the two labor supplies in the set P allows recovery of simply by applying a theorem from Chiappori (1992). Next, subsection 2.3.5.2 identi…es in the set in which one of the couple does not work (N f and N m). The recovery of on the set P can be extended to the set in which one of the couple does not work by the knowledge of the sharing rule along the participation frontier.

2.3.5.1 Identi…cation in the Partners’Participation Set

This case considers only a positive labor supply for both adults. This is the only situation implicitly considered by BCM (2005). For any wm; wf ; y 2 P such that h~my h~yf 6= 0, the following de…nitions are introduced:

A

wm; wf; y

=

h~ mwf h~ my

wm; wf; y (wm; wf ; y)

;

B

wm; wf; y

=

h~fwm wm; wf ; y h~fy (wm; wf ; y)

Note that A and B are indeed the marginal rates of substitution of the sharing

rule

wf y

=

( ) h~m wf wm;wf ;y ( ) h~m y wm;wf ;y

and

( ) wm

h~wf m wm;wf ;y

= ( ) y

h~fy wm;wf ;y

, which can be identi…ed in terms of the

observable labor supplies of m and f .

Lemma 1. It is assumed that h~ym h~fy =6 0, and ABy Bwf =6 BAy Awm for any wm; wf ; y 2 P . Then for any given K; the individual preferences and the sharing rule are identi…ed on P up to an increasing function of K.

Proof. See Lemma 1 in BCM (2005) and proposition 4 in Chiappori (1992).
The sketch of the proof is as follows. The idea under a collective framework is that the labor supply of spouse i is a¤ected by changes either in the non-labor income or in j’s wage by means of their e¤ects on the sharing rule. Therefore, from (2.3) and (2.4) it is possible to obtain a system of two partial di¤erential equations in :
47

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
wf A y = 0 and wm B y = B
The indi¤erence surfaces of i’s share can be derived in the space (wj; y) from noting that if there is a simultaneous change in non-labor income and in j’s wage that maintain i’s labor supply at the same level, then i’s share also remains constant. In addition, j’s share can be derived from the fact that both shares must add up to the non-labor income devoted to non-public consumption. The system of partial di¤erential equations can be solved if it is di¤erentiated again and if the symmetry of cross-partial derivatives is taken into account.13
The sharing rule and couples’preferences have to be adjusted to consider the presence of public expenditures. For the sharing rule and the pair of utilities U m and U f there exists a constant D K such that, for all wm; wf ; y 2 P

~ wm; wf; y U~ m hm; Cm; K
U~ f hf ; Cf ; K

= wm; wf; y + D K = gm U m hm; Cm D K ; K ; K = gf U f hf ; Cf + D K ; K ; K

where gm and gf are twice continuously di¤erentiable mappings, increasing in their …rst argument. The functions U~ i and U i are di¤erent, although impossible to distinguish solely from observation of labor supplies,14 but once D K has been chosen, U~ i and gi coincide
up to an increasing function of K.

2.3.5.2 Identi…cation When One Member of the Couple Does Not Participate

In the case where only one of the adult household members works (wi > i (wj; y) and wj j (wi; y)), the observation of i’s labor supply characterizes the sharing rule on the set

13 The solution consists of partial derivatives of the sharing rule that can be deduced from observed labor

supplies. Assuming that ABy Bwf =6 BAy Awm , let

=1

BAy Awm ABy Bwf

1
and = 1

. The partial

derivatives are given by y = , wf = A , and wm = B ( 1) = B . In words, ( ) is the share of

marginal non-labor income not devoted to public expenditures received by m (f ).

14 The intuition in the case of member m is the following. Switching from and U m to ~ and U~ m a¤ects:

1) the budget constraint of m, with a vertical translation of magnitude D K ; 2) all of m’s indi¤erence

curves are also shifted downward by D K , so m’s labor supply does not change. Because m’s consumption,

Cm, cannot be observed, ( ; U m) is empirically indistinguishable from ~; U~ m .

48

2.3. THE FRAMEWORK

N j. In addition, the values of the partial derivatives of the sharing rule are identi…ed on
j’s frontier by Lemma 1, providing boundary conditions for the identi…cation of the sharing rule on N j. Indeed, by continuity of h~i and ,15 the recovery of the sharing rule on P can be extended to the frontier between P and N j if wj approaches the participation frontier
j (wi; y).

To better understand the technique employed, the participation set N f in which member m works and f does not (i.e., wf f (wm; y)) is initially considered. For any wm; wf ; y 2 int N f such that h~my =6 0, it is de…ned that:

A

wm; wf; y

=

h~ wmf h~ ym

wm; wf; y (wm; wf ; y)

Along f ’s participation frontier, for any set If of (wm; y) such that wm following de…nition is made by a continuity argument, if limwf " f h~ym =6 0:

w^m (y), the

a (wm; y) = A wm; f (wm; y) ; y

Lemma 2. It is assumed that limwf " f h~my 6= 0 and 1 + a

f y

=6

0

for

any

(wm; y) 2 If

and

h~my =6 0 for any wm; wf ; y 2 int N f . Then the sharing rule is identi…ed on N f up to some

additive constant D K .

Proof. The same technique used by Donni (2003) can be applied; the only adjustment that must be made is that the additive constant is indexed by the level of public expenditures. From Lemma 1, it is known that must satisfy the partial di¤erential equation

wf A y = 0

(2.7)

which characterizes the sharing rule on N f . Additionally, the sharing rule along the participation frontier wf f (wm; y) = 0 gives a boundary condition for the partial di¤erential equation. From standard theorems in partial di¤erential equations theory, the identi…cation of the sharing rule (up to an additive constant) is achieved if the following condition is ful…lled. First, (2.7) can be written as 5 u = 0, where 5 denotes the gradient

15 Although h~m, h~f , and are generally nondi¤erentiable along the participation frontiers, it can be shown that couples’ labor supplies and the sharing rule are in…nitely di¤erentiable in all their arguments on P , int N f , and int (N m) (for an appropiate proof of this result see Theorem A.3 of Magnus and Neudecker 2007, 163).

CHAPTER 2. CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION IN A MODEL OF COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY
of and u is the vector (0; 1; A). Now, the condition is that u is not tangent to f ’s participation frontier. The intuition behind this condition is the following: (2.7) de…nes the indi¤erence surfaces of the sharing rule (the values of wf , wm, and y that keep constant the sharing rule at some level) that pass through f ’s participation frontier. Since 5 is a vector normal to surfaces of constant , and u indicates the direction in which the sharing rule is constant, (2.7) states that u is everywhere perpendicular to 5 . Therefore, u is a vector that is tangent to the surfaces of constant at every point and, in particular, is a tangent vector to the surface in the participation frontier of f . Given that, on the frontier, A coincides with a, this condition states that, for all (wm; y) 2 If :

1+a

f y

6=

0

If this condition is ful…lled on the frontier, then the partial di¤erential equation (2.7) together with the boundary condition de…nes up to an additive constant, D K , in the context analyzed.

Now, the participation set N m in which only member f works (i.e., wm m wf ; y ) is considered. The approach is the same as that for N f . For any wm; wf ; y 2 int (N m) such that h~yf 6= 0, it is de…ned that:

B

wm; wf; y

=

h~wf m wm; wf ; y h~fy (wm; wf ; y)

Along m’s participation frontier, for any set Im of wf ; y such that wf following de…nition is made by a continuity argument, if limwm" m h~yf =6 0:

wm B y = B and the boundary condition wm m wf ; y = 0.

2.4. FINAL REMARKS
2.4 Final Remarks
The richness of collective models comes from the opportunities the framework provides for considering the theoretical foundations of how individuals share resources within a basic unit of analysis in an intragroup decision-making process such as a household. In this sense, the approach could serve as an empirical tool for understanding intrahousehold allocations, particularly when evaluating policies with a targeting purpose. However, the literature on identifying the structural elements of household behavior in a more general case than private consumption with interior solutions is relatively recent. In particular, the literature has provided some results based on the separate consideration of the presence of children and non-working individuals within a household.
This chapter extends Chiappori’s (1992) model of collective labor supply to bring together the decision to participate in the labor market and expenditures on public goods, such as expenditures on children. The chapter unites in a single framework the works of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005) for children and Donni (2003) for non-participation. The model generates testable restrictions on household labor supply behavior. In particular, labor supply functions have to satisfy certain structural conditions in the form of partial di¤erential equations. Moreover, the model can recover individual preferences and the sharing rule from the simple observation of adult members’ labor supply and expenditure on children. Identi…ability when at least one of the partners works requires i) the knowledge of a distribution factor to control for the e¤ect of public consumption on the optimal individual choice of consumption and labor supply; and ii) the explicit postulation of a unique reservation wage to identify the structure in the non-participation sets of each household member.
Two topics for future research are the consideration of household production and empirical application of the model. Wefare comparisons at the individual level can be biased if household production is not taken into account. For example, the specialization of a woman in domestic activities is interpreted as an increase in her individual leisure consumption; her share of household non-labor income is interpreted as a lump-sum transfer from her partner instead of the exchange of her domestic production for market goods. Also, the stochastic speci…cation of the model has to take into account that wages are not observed for non-participants, and that both the labor supply of the participating member and the sharing rule have to be continuous at the participation frontier of the other member. The data necessary for future applications of the model can generally be obtained from household income and expenditure surveys. This type of survey includes information on household

Chapter 3
Collective Household Labor Supply: An Empirical Approach with Children and Non-Participation
3.1 Introduction
This chapter expands on the empirical literature of collective household labor supply by implementing the model proposed in chapter 2, which simultaneously takes into account the presence of children and the decision to participate in the labor market. The individual preferences of the couple as well as the rule governing the sharing of household resources conditional on expenditures on children are recovered from estimates of adult household members’ labor supply and those expenditures. The chapter also investigates whether expenditures on children and male labor supply depend on the woman’s wage even when she is not working. Mexican data for nuclear families in which the male partner works are used to estimate this model and test the restrictions implied by it.
As in other developing countries, Mexico’s female labor force participation is still at a very low level (Arceo and Campos 2010). However, this low participation does not necessarily imply that women’s preferences are not taken into account in household resource allocations. If (potential) wages a¤ect bargaining positions within a household, then any variation in the wage of a female household member will modify household behavior even if she does not work.
There is little empirical literature on collective household labor supply behavior that separately considers the presence of children (Cherchye, de Rock, and Vermeulen forthcoming
53

CHAPTER 3. COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY: AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH WITH CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION
and chapter 1 of this dissertation) and the decision to participate in the labor market (Blundell, Chiappori, Magnac, and Meghir 2007; Bloemen 2010), and there is no empirical literature that considers the two issues simultaneously. In this chapter a …rst attempt is made to …ll this gap with an empirical implementation of the theoretical model presented in chapter 2. This chapter recovers the rule governing the sharing of household resources conditional on the level of expenditures on children from estimates of a system of equations comprising the woman’s participation, the couple’s labor supplies, and expenditures on children. Despite rejection of the supplementary assumption of continuity of both the male’s labor supply and the sharing rule, the parameter restrictions that are imposed by the collective rationality are not rejected.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 brie‡y discusses the model developed in chapter 2, which includes the possibility of labor force participation and public consumption (like expenses on children). Section 3.3 proposes how to specify the model parametrically, section 3.4 shows the data set used, and section 3.5 presents empirical results. Some …nal remarks are presented in section 3.6.
3.2 Theoretical Framework
This chapter implements the model presented in chapter 2 of collective household labor supply which, based on the models of Donni (2003) and Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir (2005), introduces the possibility of non-participation in a framework where parents care about children’s welfare. In this section we discuss the main features of the model, which was discussed in detail in chapter 2.
In a household composed of an adult couple and their o¤spring, it is assumed that: i) (potential) wages could a¤ect bargaining positions of the couple; ii) the utility of each adult member depends on his or her individual consumption and the children’s well-being; and iii) the decision about how much is spent on children a¤ects the trade-o¤ between consumption and labor supply at the individual level. Under these assumptions, chapter 2 shows that the underlying structure of the model (individual preferences and the decision process) can be recovered from observed behavior. Identi…ability is feasible if we know a distribution factor (i.e., a variable that a¤ects the decision process but not the individual preferences or the joint budget set), and there is a unique reservation wage for each adult household member at which both members are indi¤erent as to whether a member participates in the labor market or not.
54

3.2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Formally, let i = m, f denote, respectively, the household’s male and female members. The labor supply of i is denoted by hi (with 0 hi 1), with market wage wi. There is a Hicksian good whose price is set to unity that is used for private expenditures (Ci) and for public expenditures –in this chapter, expenditures on children, (K). Let Y and z denote, respectively, household non-labor income and a distribution factor.1 It is assumed that hm, hf , and K are observed (as functions of wm, wf , Y , and z), whereas, as is standard in the literature on the collective model, the distribution of private consumption within the couple is not.

The basic idea of the collective approach lies in the assumption that intrahousehold

decisions lead to Pareto-e¢ cient outcomes, so it is not necessary to make additional

assumptions about the decision process. In the case of private and public goods, the

e¢ ciency assumption implies the existence of a (conditional) sharing rule; the portion of

non-labor income allocated to each member once spending on the public good has been

discounted. In this case, the household decision process can be thought of as a two-stage

process. In the …rst stage, the couple agrees on the level of the public expenditure and how

to distribute the resulting residual non-labor income between them. To be more concrete, let K wm; wf ; Y; z and i wm; wf ; Y; z denote, respectively, the optimal choice of expenditures on children and i’s share of residual non-labor income, with m wm; wf ; Y; z +
f wm; wf ; Y; z = Y K wm; wf ; Y; z . The Bowen-Lindahl-Samuelson condition

characterizes the e¢ ciency for public expenditures; individual marginal willingness to pay

for expenditures on children must add up to its market price (M W P m + M W P f = 1,

stage the couple decide, independently from one another, their individual consumption and

labor supply. Fixing K = K wm; wf ; Y; z , the labor supply and consumption functions,

hi wm; wf ; Y; z and Ci wm; wf ; Y; z , solve as:

max U i 1 hi; Ci; K
hi ;C i

s:t: Ci = wihi + i;

i = m; f

In what follows, with the idea of focusing on the information contained in the couple’s labor supplies, public expenditures are …xed to some arbitrary level K. Using the condition K wm; wf ; Y; z = K, the distribution factor can be expressed, by the implicit function
1 The distribution factors are de…ned as variables that a¤ect the distribution of the bargaining power between household members, but that do not have any direct in‡uence on the individuals’preferences and the household budget set (after controlling for total income). For a more detailed discussion of distribution factors, see section 1.2; for examples of some that have been used in the literature, see Table A.1.

theorem, as a function of wm; wf ; Y; K . Following from this construction, the couples’ structural labor supplies are:

h~m wm; wf ; Y; K h~f wm; wf ; Y; K

= Hm wm; wm; wf; Y; wm; wf; Y; K

= Hf wf; Y K

wm; wf; Y; wm; wf; Y; K

(3.1) (3.2)

where = m. In this way, i’s labor supply is described as a function of wages, non-labor income, and a distribution factor z such that public expenditures are exactly K. Hence, the values of wm, wf , and Y are not constrained to assure that K wm; wf ; Y; z = K; the key role of z is to guarantee that the level of public expenditures is exactly K. From (3.1) and (3.2) it follows that j’s wage rate enters i’s labor supply function only through the sharing rule. In this way, the problem is basically reduced to that considered by Donni (2003), in which the participation decision is analyzed in a framework with only private goods.
Blundell et al. (2005) show that when both partners work, the knowledge of the two labor supply functions (3.1) and (3.2) allows recovery of the conditional sharing rule and the individual utilities of the couple. Using a theorem in Chiappori (1992), the sharing rule can be recovered by solving a system of …rst- and second-order order partial di¤erentials of the two labor supply functions conditional on the public-good expenditure.2
As in the standard unitary framework, the de…nition of a reservation wage can be used in the collective framework to address the decision to participate in the labor market. However, because the wage of one partner a¤ects the labor supply of the other via the sharing rule, the sharing rule itself could also depend on the non-participation decision of the couple. Therefore, under the collective approach, the uniqueness of a reservation wage has to be explicitly postulated in order to recover the decision process when one member of the couple does not participate in the labor market. The reservation wage of i ($i) is de…ned by:
$i = Uhii 1; i; K UCi i 1; i;K

This equation is the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and private consumption computed along the axis hi = 0 for a given sharing rule i (and equal to

Ci) and a level of public expenditures equal to K. Let y = Y K denotes the portion of the household’s non-labor income devoted to private expenditures. Therefore, if $i is a function of wm; wf ; Y; K , it can be expressed for notational simplicity as $i wm; wf ; y . A su¢ cient condition to obtain a unique reservation wage for each member is to de…ne the function $i as a contraction mapping (assumption R in subsection 2.3.4). The recovering of the sharing rule when both partners work can be extended to the case in which one of the couple does not work by knowledge of the rule along the participation frontier. The sharing rule when i chooses not to work and j 6= i chooses to work is de…ned by the partial di¤erential equation of j’s labor supply in and the fact that both the sharing rule and j’s labor supply are continuous along i’s participation frontier.3

3.3 Parametric Speci…cation
This section proposes an empirical implementation of the model developed in chapter 2. Speci…c functional forms and simplifying assumptions have been chosen to give a simple but realistic illustration of the model.

3.3.1 Preferences, Labor Supply, Expenditures on Children, and the Sharing Rule
For the illustration of the collective model with expenditures on children and non-participation, it is important to have some relatively simple parametric speci…cation in mind. When both partners work, their individual structural labor supply functions can be speci…ed as:

hm = hf =

0 + 1 m + 2 ln wm + 3K 0 + 1 f + 2 ln wf + 3K

(3.3) (3.4)

This kind of semi-log speci…cation is popular in empirical work (Blundell, MaCurdy, and Meghir 2007), and also it has already been used in the collective empirical literature
3 When only the male partner works, the partial di¤erential equation of his labor supply in is determined by wf D y = 0.
57

CHAPTER 3. COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY: AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH WITH CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION
(Chiappori, Fortin, and Lacroix 2002). The fact that equations (3.3) and (3.4) are linear in parameters eases the estimation process. The underlying indirect utility functions of the labor supply functions (3.3) and (3.4) are of the Stern (1986) type:

V m (wm; m) = exp( 1wm) ( 0 + 1 m + 2 ln wm + 3K)

Applying Roy’s identity to each of these indirect utility functions yields the individual labor supply system (3.3) and (3.4). In this speci…cation, K appears non-separably in the utility function of both members.4 Note that the e¢ ciency condition for public-good expenditures (M W P m + M W P f = 1) implies the following restriction in parameters:

As in Chiappori et al. (2002), the sharing rule is speci…ed as:5

(3.5)

= 0 + 1Y + 2 ln wm + 3 ln wf + 4 ln wm ln wf + 5z = 0W

(3.6)

From the de…nition of the sharing rule, the expenditure on children has to satisfy the

identity K = Y

m + f , so that the reduced form is speci…ed as:

K = c0 + c1Y + c2 ln wm + c3 ln wf + c4 ln wm ln wf + c5z

(3.7)

4 A similar speci…cation has been used by Conway (1997) to analyze the e¤ect of income taxation and government spending on both sexes’labor supply behavior.
5 The interaction between log wage rates is included in the speci…cation of the sharing rule because the identi…ability of the sharing rule depends on the …rst and second derivatives of both partners’labor supply functions; the second-order cross-partial derivatives with respect to wages do not vanish.

3.3. PARAMETRIC SPECIFICATION
= c0W

Inserting the sharing rule (3.6) in the structural labor supply functions (3.3) and (3.4), the reduced functions are:

hm = a0 + a1Y + a2 ln wm + a3 ln wf + a4 ln wm ln wf + a5z = a0W
hf = b0 + b1Y + b2 ln wm + b3 ln wf + b4 ln wm ln wf + b5z = b0W

(3.8) (3.9)

3.3.2 Restrictions of the Model

With the intention to focus on labor supplies, the level of public expenditures is …xed to K wm; wf ; Y; z = K. Hence, using the change in variable y = Y K and rearranging equation (3.7), the distribution factor can be expressed as:

1 z = (1
c5

c1) K

c0

c1y

c2 ln wm

c3 ln wf

c4 ln wm ln wf

(3.10)

Therefore, using (3.10), the reduced labor supply functions (3.8) and (3.9) can be written also as:

hm = A0 + A1y + A2 ln wm + A3 ln wf + A4 ln wm ln wf + A5K hf = B0 + B1y + B2 ln wm + B3 ln wf + B4 ln wm ln wf + B5K

(3.11) (3.12)

The relation between the parameters of the equations (3.8)-(3.9) and the parameters of (3.11) and (3.12) is shown in Table 3.1.
Using equations (3.11) and (3.12), the conditional sharing rule when both partners work, in terms of the household non-labor income devoted to private expenditures and wages, is characterized by the partial derivatives (see footnote 2):

Solving this system of di¤erential equations, the conditional sharing rule recovered is:

Table 3.2 shows the parameters of the sharing rule (3.6) and its conditional version (3.13) in terms of the reduced labor suppply functions (3.8-3.9, 3.11-3.12), with = (a1c5 a5c1) (b4c5 b5c4) (a4c5 a5c4) (b1c5 b5c1) and ~0 as an unknown constant.

labor supply functions, it is required that the ratio of the marginal e¤ects of the interaction between log wage rates has to be equal to the corresponding ratio of the marginal e¤ects of the distribution factor on labor supplies. This restriction stems from the fact that the cross term and the distribution factor enter the labor supply functions only through the sharing rule.
The restriction (3.15) relates the ratio of the marginal e¤ects of the expenditures on children (K) on each partner’s labor supply functions. The marginal e¤ect of K is the sum of two terms. The …rst (a1 and b1) is the marginal e¤ect that corresponds to the individual preferences via a change in the household’s non-labor income. The second term [a5 /c5 (1 c1) and b5 /c5 (1 c1)] is the marginal change of K on the sharing rule via the distribution factor. Therefore, changes in the expenditures on children only impact individual labor supply functions through income e¤ects, the impact for both partners being equal.
Finally, the parameters of the structural labor supplies (3.3) and (3.4) can be expressed in terms of the parameters of their reduced form (Table 3.3).

If the female partner does not work, there is a regime switch in the male partner’s labor supply and the sharing rule, and the parameters change:

hm = a0 + a1Y + a2 ln wm + a3 ln wf + a4 ln wm ln wf + a5z = a0W = 0 + 1Y + 2 ln wm + 3 ln wf + 4 ln wm ln wf + 5z = 0W

(3.16) (3.17)

To identify the decision process, the model imposes the restrictions that both the male’s labor supply function and the sharing rule have to be continuous along the female’s participation frontier:

a0W = a0W + s (b0W) 0W = 0W + r (b0W)

(3.18) (3.19)

Using the partial di¤erential equation of the male’s labor supply in , a relation between s and r is obtained when the female partner does not work:

~3 + rB3 + (~4 + rB4) ln wm = A3 + sB3 + (A4 + sB4) ln wm

(~1 + rB1) wf

(A1 + sB1) wf

Using the equalities of the parameters of the sharing rule (3.13) shown in Table 3.2, the relation r = sB4 is obtained.

Up to this point it has been assumed that both partners’ wages are always observed, even if someone is not working. In order to estimate the model (3.20-3.21), the following equations are speci…ed for women:

ln wtf = ln wtm ln wtf =

0Xtwf + ut

X 0
twf wm

+

ut

(3.22) (3.23)

Based on Wooldridge (2002), for non-working women the empirical analysis uses a Tobit selection procedure for imputing both a wage rate and the interaction between the couple’s wage rates, taking into account the simultaneity between expenditures on children and the couple’s labor decisions. First, using all of the sample, a standard Tobit of htf on all the exogenous variables is estimated:

hft = b0 + b1Y + b2 ln wm + ~0Xtwf + ~ 0Xtwf wm + b5z+ f Xtf + K XtK + vt 64

3.4. DATA
Thus, all variables that determine the female’s log wage rate are included as well as the cross product of the couple’s log wage rates and expenditures on children. Then, using observations for which hft > 0, equations (3.22) and (3.23) are estimated including the residuals v^t from the previous step as a covariate. In this parametric approach, the female’s log wage rate and the cross product of the couple’s log wage rate equations are identi…ed from the exclusion of household non-labor income, the distribution factor, the male partner’s age and education, a second-order polynomial in the number of children in the household under 15, and a dummy variable for the number of children under …ve. To identify the e¤ect of the woman’s log wage rate and the cross product of the couple’s log wage rate on the woman’s labor supply, it is necessary that Xtwf and Xtwf wm each contain at least one variable not in Xtf and XtK. The chosen variables for Xtf are the cross product of the woman’s age and education (see, e.g., Mroz 1987), and the unemployment rate by state and by year-quarter of the …rst survey visit to the household as a means of accounting for local labor market conditions. For Xtwf wm, the male partner’s log wage, the same variables considered for Xtf , and the interaction between them. The choice of instruments was based on the discussion in Wooldridge (2002) of identi…cation in simultaneous equations models that are nonlinear in endogenous variables, particularly models with interactions between exogenous variables (here, ln wtm) and endogenous variables (here, ln wtf ).
Finally, the …tted values of ln wf and ln wm ln wf are calculated, correcting for selection bias l[ n wtf = ^0Xtwf ; ln w\ m ln wf = ^ 0Xtwf wm .
3.4 Data
A survey that satis…es the data requirements for applying the model is the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS/ENNVIH for its abbreviation in Spanish). It is a multi-thematic and longitudinal survey, elaborated by researchers of the Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA) and the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE).
From the original sample (8,328 households), a subsample is …rst extracted from the second wave (2005-2006) that includes nuclear families only with children under 15 years of age (1,921 households, 48.15% of nuclear families). The reason for using only nuclear families is to focus on households where the decision process is centralized in the parents, reducing the possibility of interaction with other kin within the household. Also, the analysis is focused on children under 15 because a child of this age is not likely to have bargaining power in household decisions.

CHAPTER 3. COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY: AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH WITH CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION
Next, the sample is restricted to couples living together, where both the male and the female are less than 60 years of age. The sample excludes households where a member is unemployed (the choice between working or not has to be freely-made, to avoid misinterpretation of the …ndings), self-employed (to avoid problems in measuring labor income), or working without remuneration. Households where the male partner is not employed are dropped because their number is negligible in the subsample. These selection rules and the exclusion of households with missing and outlier data leave us with a total of 1,002 households. The information on wage rates and working hours of both partners is used, as well as information on women with missing wage rates. Expenditures on children include education (enrollment fees, exams, school supplies, uniforms, and transportation), clothes and shoes, toys, and clothes and items for babies. Non-labor income is the annual household current income minus the couple’s labor incomes.
Table 3.4 reports descriptive statistics of the …nal sample. In this sample, only 18 percent of women participate in the labor market (180 of 1,002 women). The low female participation rate represents a challenge to the model estimation since the procedure for imputing potential wages to all women in the sample is based upon the information from working women. The mean annual number of working hours is 308 for all women in the sample and 2,408 for men. However, working women have on average an hourly wage rate higher than men (MXN $43 versus $29). Using the procedure described in the previous section, the female’s log wage rate and the interaction between the couple’s log wage rates are then replaced for all observations by their respective …tted values (see Table B.1). There is no signi…cant di¤erence in years of education (approximately eight years). The mean age for women is about two years less than that of men.
In the collective framework, the intrahousehold decision process depends on a range of variables that re‡ects the household environment. These variables, also known as distribution factors, leave the individual preferences and the joint budget set unchanged and can only shift the distribution of power. The sex ratio is a distribution factor that is a proxy for the situation in the couple-matching market; it re‡ects the couple’s outside opportunities and can in‡uence ultimately the …nal allocation of resources. It has been used by Chiappori, Fortin, and Lacroix (2002) and Park (2007), among others. In theory, a higher sex ratio (denoting a smaller percentage of women on the couple-matching market) improves the female’s bargaining position; if the relationship dissolves, she has a higher probability of …nding a new partner than he does, so he is willing to concede to her a larger share of the gains of living in a couple in order to avoid an end to the relationship. Following Park (2007), two kinds of sex ratio variables at the state level are constructed using the microdata
66

3.4. DATA
sample data from the Conteo de Población y Vivienda of 2005. The age-to-age sex ratio is the number of men of the same age as the male partner of each household over the corresponding number of women. A 2-year-band sex ratio is also calculated; this ratio uses the weighted sum of women who are at most two years younger than the male partner of the household.6 This alternative distribution factor is probably a better summary measure of the couple-matching market, since in the sample there is on average a di¤erence of two years in the couple’s ages.

CHAPTER 3. COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY: AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH WITH CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION
3.5 Estimation Results

Tables 3.5-3.7 and B.2 show the parameter estimates of the unrestricted model (3.20-3.21),

which assumes that the male’s labor supply function is continuous along the female’s

participation frontier, and its associated collective version, which imposes the restrictions

(3.14-3.15) in the estimation process (the constrained parameters are identi…ed with the

symbol yy). Two versions are estimated, one using the age-to-age sex ratio variable as a

distribution factor (denoted by (1)), and the other using the 2-year-band sex ratio variable

(denoted by (2)). Using the set of log-likelihood values for each model (see Table B.2) it is

possible to construct likelihood-ratio statistics to test the collective restrictions (3.14-3.15).

In the version employing the age-to-age (2-year-band) sex ratio, the test statistic of 1.79

(4.55) is to be compared with the critical value of

2 0:05

(2)

=

5:99.

The collective

model

is

not rejected for the two sex ratio versions even at the 1% level. This …nding is consistent

with the hypothesis that the presence of children in a household generates non-separabilities

in individual consumption, since other documents that have not explicitly considered this

aspect have usually rejected the collective rationality when they analyze a household with

children (see Fortin and Lacroix 1997; Donni 2007). In general terms, the two constraints,

(3.14) and (3.15), imposed on the parameters by the collective model do not appear to be very

restrictive, since their implied values are relatively close to their unconstrained counterparts,

an observation consistent with the likelihood-ratio test of collective rationality. However,

only 32 parameters of the unrestricted version with the age-to-age sex ratio, out of 65, are

statistically signi…cant at the 10% level (31 for the version with the 2-year-band ratio). For

the collective model, only 30 (age-to-age) and 28 (2-year-band) are signi…cant at the same

level. Although the e¤ect of some important variables is quite precisely measured, this

limited number of signi…cant parameters can be explained, at least partially, by the small

size of the sample.

Table 3.5 presents the estimates of the parameters of expenditures on children. The magnitudes of the coe¢ cients are very similar in the unrestricted and the collective versions. The marginal e¤ect of a change in the male’s wage rate on the expenditures on children is c2 + c4 ln wf /wm , so for all speci…cations and everything else being equal, an increase in the male’s wage rate implies an increase in the money spent on children if the female’s wage is more than MXN $8 [that is if wf > exp ( c2=c4)], which is the case for the large majority of the sample. For example, in both versions of the unrestricted model, at the mean wage rate of both parents, a MXN $1 increase in the male’s wage (equivalent to an annual increase of MXN $2,408 in labor income at the mean hours worked by men) increases
68

3.5. ESTIMATION RESULTS
the annual expenditure on children by approximately MXN $61. The marginal e¤ect of the female’s wage rate is determined by (c3 + c4 ln wm) wf . The marginal e¤ect of the female’s wage rate is positive if the male’s wage is larger than MXN $23 using the age-to-age sex ratio as distribution factor, and $26 with the 2-year-band (that is if wm > exp ( c3=c4)); it is positive for just over half of the sample. In the unrestricted model with the age-to-age sex ratio as distribution factor and at the mean wage rate of both parents, a MXN $1 increase in the mother’s wage (equivalent to an annual increase of MXN $308 in her labor income, at the mean hours worked by women) increases the annual expenditure on children by approximately MXN $5 (approximately $2 with the 2-year-band). The non-labor income seems not to be statistically signi…cant at conventional levels.
The age-to-age sex ratio has a negative and statistically signi…cant e¤ect on expenditures on children; for example, a one-standard deviation increase in the age-to-age sex ratio (0.07 points) reduces the annual money spent on children by approximately MXN $646 in the unrestricted model. Because an increase in the sex ratio is related to an increase in the bargaining power of the female partner (and a corresponding decrease in that of the male partner), this result suggests initially that fathers care more for their children than mothers (under the proposed speci…cation, the adequate indicator of parents’preferences regarding children is their marginal willingness to pay, whose estimated values are shown later in this chapter). These results thus reject the implication of the unitary approach that no distribution factor is associated with intra-household allocations.
Most parameter estimates of the control variables are statistically signi…cant at conventional levels. As expected, the presence of a larger number of children under 15 increases the expenditure on them. However, if a child under …ve is present, if all else is equal, the expenditures are reduced. Children under …ve contribute to higher expenditures through the count of total children, but an autonomous correction is made since there are no school expenditures for them and thus the total measure of expenditures on children tends to be smaller. Parents’education has a positive e¤ect on the expenditures on children, especially the female’s; while an additional year in the male’s education increases the annual money spent on children by approximately MXN $215, that same factor in the female’s education increases the expenditure by MXN $300.

3.5. ESTIMATION RESULTS
Table 3.6 shows the estimates of the parameters of the reduced female household member’s labor supply function. The own-wage e¤ect of female labor supply is determined by (b3 + b4 ln wm) wf . This is positive at male hourly wage rates inferior to MXN $9 but the negative backward bending e¤ect dominates for higher male wage rates. Therefore, if the husband earns more than MXN $9, a higher potential wage for the woman does not result in a greater labor supply for her; only if the man earns less than MXN $9 is the wife inclined to work more hours. The cross-wage e¤ect of female labor supply, b2 + b4 ln wf /wm , is positive for female wage rates less than MXN $62 in the model with the age-to-age sex ratio as a distribution factor (and for rates less than MXN $59 using the 2-year-band). Thus, for the most relevant female wage range, all other factors being equal, women who participate work more if the husband has a higher wage, but for those women who do not work, the probability of starting to participate increases with the wage of their partner. In sum, the own-wage income e¤ect tends to dominate the substitution e¤ect for very small values of the male wage rate, while a woman tends to increase her working hours upon a wage increase of her partner within a wide range of her own wage rate.
The parameter of the sex ratio variable in the couple’s reduced labor supply functions is the result of two e¤ects, one an e¤ect of the sharing rule and the other of the expenditures on children (see the couple’s structural labor supply functions (3.3) and (3.4)). Interestingly, the e¤ect of both sex ratios on the female’s labor supply is positive, but imprecisely determined, in both the unrestricted and collective model. In the collective version, the magnitude of both sex ratios is smaller and better determined: the age-to-age sex ratio parameter passes from a p-value of 60% in the unrestricted model to 21% in the collective one, while the corresponding value for the 2-year-band falls from 53% to 33%.
With respect to the control variables, the female household member’s age and education have a signi…cantly positive e¤ect on her labor supply. As expected, an increase in the number of children, other factors being equal, is accompanied by a decrease in her number of hours worked; the presence of a pre-school child also reduces the number of hours worked.

3.5. ESTIMATION RESULTS

Table 3.7 reports the estimates of the parameters of the reduced male labor supply function. In a working couple, the own-wage e¤ect of the labor supply, a2 + a4 ln wf /wm , is always negative and the cross-wage e¤ect, (a3 + a4 ln wm) wf , is positive for a wide range of male wage rates. The former indicates a backward bending of the male labor supply, and the latter suggests that men tend to increase working hours upon a wage increase of their partner. Evidence of this male labor supply behavior has been also found for the Netherlands by Bloemen (2010) and Kapteyn, Kooreman, and van Soest (1990) when male and female labor supply is estimated simultaneously.

Comparing the unrestricted model with the collective one, there is a change of sign in the e¤ect of both sex ratios on the male labor supply; it passes from a positive e¤ect to a negative one. The constraints (3.14) and (3.15) imposed by the collective model seem to be restrictive regarding the in‡uence of distribution factors on the male’s hours worked. Nevertheless, only the unrestricted model with the 2-year-band sex ratio as a distribution factor is statistically signi…cant at the 5% level. Within the control variables, only the male’s education is signi…cant (with a positive sign for all estimated versions) in the male’s labor supply.

The parameter estimate of s, associated to (3.18), that determines the assumption of a

regime switch in the male’s labor supply and its continuity along the female participation

frontier, is negative but not estimated precisely. Bloemen (2010), under a similar logic

of the parametric speci…cation for a sample of all the possible combinations of working

and non-working partners, has found for a sample of Dutch couples that the corresponding

parameter for a working husband and a non-working wife is statistically signi…cant, whereas

the parameter associated to a working wife and a non-working husband is not signi…cantly

di¤erent from zero. This unsatisfactory result does not constitute a rejection of the collective

approach but instead a rejection of the auxiliary assumptions of a continuous regime switch

of the male labor supply function due to a change in the female’s participation decision.

Female non-participation in the labor market a¤ects the working hours of her partner via

her potential wage and the correlation between them ( np;f

0:53, see Table B.2), but

a non-working female partner does not involve a continuous shift in the male labor supply.

The reason for the rejection of a regime switch may be that the female reservation wage

tends to show little variation and is only captured by the correlation coe…cient.

3.5. ESTIMATION RESULTS
With respect to the nuisance parameters (Table B.2), all the standard deviations of the dependent variables are estimated precisely. Additionally, the only correlations that are statistically signi…cant at the 10% level are those between the female’s participation equation and the male’s labor supply when she does not work (negative), and the female’s participation equation and the expenditures on children (positive). These …ndings suggest that unobserved variables that in‡uence women’s decision to participate in the labor market are negatively correlated with those that similarly in‡uence men’s hours worked, and positively correlated with money spent on children.
Given the empirical framework of section 3.3, it is possible to recover the parameters of the conditional sharing rule (3.6) and (3.13) when both partners work, as well as the parameter r in (3.19) that allows a regime switch in the sharing rule if the female partner does not work and its continuity along the female’s participation frontier. The parameter estimates are presented in Table 3.8. Here also the version employing the age-to-age sex ratio variable as a distribution factor is denoted by (1), and the one using the 2-year-band sex ratio variable is denoted by (2). The parameters turn out to be not very precisely estimated; the most signi…cant parameter is the one related to non-labor income (both the total in speci…cation (3.6) and the one that discounts the expenditures on children in speci…cation (3.13)), with a p-value of approximately 10.3%. The parameter of non-labor income is around 0.57, indicating that couples seem to share their non-labor income such that 57% goes to man and the remaining 43% to the woman.
The marginal e¤ect of the male and female wage rate on the sharing rule (3.6) is 2 + 4 ln wf /wm and ( 3 + 4 ln wm) wf , respectively. The marginal e¤ect on the speci…cation (3.13) is ~2 + ~4 ln wf /wm and (~3 + ~4 ln wm) wf . The estimated parameters of the sharing rule using the age-to-age sex ratio thus imply that, as long as the female’s hourly wage is less than approximately MXN $67, all other factors being equal, the female partner bene…ts, in terms of a non-labor income transfer, from an increase in the male’s wage (and for rates less than approximately MXN $74 with the 2-year-band). The female’s share also bene…ts from increases in her wage within a wide range of the male’s wage rate. By way of illustration, the parameter estimates of the conditional sharing rule equation (3.13), with the level of expenditures on children …xed, indicate that in the collective model with the age-to-age sex ratio variable as distribution factor and at the mean wage rate of both parents, a MXN $1 increase in the male’s wage (equivalent to an annual increase of MXN $2,408 in his labor income, at the mean hours worked by men) induces him to transfer an additional MXN $214 to the female partner. Also, an extra MXN $1,367 will be transferred to the female partner when her wage increases MXN $1 (equivalent to an annual increase

of MXN $308 in her labor income, at the mean hours worked by women). Hence, at the mean wage rate of both parents, part of the male’s gain in labor income is transferred to his partner, whereas the female’s wage increase dramatically improves her bargaining position; she is able to keep the direct gains and in addition extract a larger portion of household non-labor income devoted to private expenditures.
The parameter estimate of r, associated to (3.19), that determines the assumption of a regime switch in the sharing rule and its continuity along the female’s participation frontier, is not signi…cantly di¤erent from zero; the previously estimated values of the sharing rule’s parameters are maintained when the female partner does not work. In Bloemen (2010), the corresponding parameter for a working woman with a non-working husband is also not signi…cantly di¤erent from zero. Although the non-participation of a female partner would have reduced overall household resources, it does not imply a shift in the resources toward her. For the sample used, the female’s bargaining power does not seem to be a¤ected by her non-participation in the labor market. Nevertheless, the male partner’s share decreases if the wage rate of his partner increases, regardless of her labor status. The wage rate of a non-working woman may still function as a threat point.
The reason that the male labor supply and the sharing rule of a working man and his non-working female partner is not signi…cantly di¤erent from the male labor supply and the sharing rule of a working couple may be that reservation wages of women tend to be very low and show little variation in the sample used. In this scenario, there is a negligible reduction in overall resources for the household when the woman is not working, so there is no visible response in the male partner’s hours worked or in the distribution of household non-labor income.
Using the estimates of the parameters of the expenditures on children and the reduced form labor supply equations from Tables 3.5-3.7, the parameters of the structural individual labor supply functions (3.3) and (3.4) can be computed using the expressions in Table 3.3. It should …rst be observed that, in general terms, the parameters in Table 3.9 are not estimated precisely. The small sample size, together with the low variation in the potential wage, can explain part of this result. Nevertheless, if the marginal willingness to pay for expenditures on children is calculated for each member (M W P m = 3 / 1 and M W P f = 3 / 1 ), the male partner seems to care more for the children than the female: an increase of MXN $1 in the male’s share, m, is associated with an increase of MXN $1.3 in the money spent on children; a corresponding increase in the female’s share is associated with a reduction of MXN $0.3.

3.6. FINAL REMARKS
3.6 Final Remarks
This chapter has speci…ed an empirical model of collective household labor supply, based on the theoretical model of chapter 2, that jointly considers the non-participation of one partner of the household couple and the presence of children. As a basis for the model, it speci…es each partner’s labor supply function, based on individual preferences, as a linear function of their own log wage rate, the sharing rule, and expenditures on children. Also, the sharing rule and expenditures on children functions are de…ned as a linear function of individuals’ and the cross product of the couple’s log wage rates, household non-labor income, and a distribution factor.
The chapter provides empirical evidence on the relevance of factors that in‡uence the couple’s bargaining positions, such as the female’s potential wage rate and the state-level sex ratio, and through these factors the household resource allocations. The stochastic speci…cation consists of the estimation, by full-information maximum likelihood, of the couple’s reduced labor supply functions by a type 4 Tobit (or switching regression) model simultaneously with the child expenditure function. The two sex ratios considered are the age-to-age and 2-year-band state-level sex ratios. The empirical analysis is based on the couple’s labor supplies and expenditures on children of Mexican nuclear families drawn from the 2005-2006 wave of the MxFLS. Unconstrained and constrained versions of the model are estimated.
The estimated parameters satisfy the conditions imposed by the proposed collective labor supply model. Previous studies that included a household group with the presence of more than one child or pre-school children (such as Fortin and Lacroix 1997; Donni 2007) have generally rejected the restrictions implied by the collective rationality. As in chapter 1, there is no evidence here that empowering mothers is more bene…cial to the children than empowering fathers; indeed, there is a larger increase in expenditure on children if their fathers, rather than mothers, are empowered. Cherchye, de Rock, and Vermeulen (forthcoming) have also found this unanticipated behavior in a sample of Dutch couples.
Another important …nding is that expenditures on children and male labor supply vary signi…cantly with the female wage even when the woman is not working. Nevertheless, the auxiliary assumptions of a continuous regime switch on the male labor supply and sharing rule functions to a change on the female participation decision are rejected; the di¤erence between the labor supply and sharing rule functions of a working man and his non-working partner and the corresponding functions of a working couple are not statistically signi…cant.
79

CHAPTER 3. COLLECTIVE HOUSEHOLD LABOR SUPPLY: AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH WITH CHILDREN AND NON-PARTICIPATION
The reservation wages of non-working female partners may be relatively low and without su¢ cient ‡uctuation.
A more particular formulation consists of the use of a closed form for the female’s shadow wage rate and thus accounts for rationing in the woman’s hours worked. Introducing this wage into the male’s labor supply function, the latter is continuous everywhere. Additionally, one can assume that the sharing rule is the same without considering the female’s labor participation change.
The lack of precision of the sharing rule actually indicates avenues for further empirical exploration. For instance, although the sample of households of working couple without o¤spring was enlarged by including households with a non-working female partner and children under 15 years of age, the imprecision of some parameters may still be due to the small sample size. In particular, the female’s potential wage rate has been estimated using information from only 18% of households, the percentage corresponding to that of working women in the sample.7 Also, because extended families are common in developing countries, it would be desirable to extend the model to include the possibility of a household with more than two persons with bargaining power. In this case, it would be necessary to have a private good that was consumed by each member with power and a distribution factor that a¤ected the distribution of power for each of those members.
7 For future research, a possible means of obtaining greater precision would be to estimate the wage equation using a larger sample, like the Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo (ENOE). This sample would have to include exactly the same variables used in the wage equation for a similiar group of women.
