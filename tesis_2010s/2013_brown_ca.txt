Abstract The aim of this work is to study the role of capabilities in the national innovation systems of both developed and emerging countries, as well as their impact on economic growth. To do so, it uses factor analysis on 22 indicators and 50 countries to develop composite variables of social and technological capabilities. The results show that the development of technological capabilities is highly correlated with subsequent economic growth. However, the returns of the improvement of technological capabilities on economic growth will depend inversely on the distance to the world technology frontier.

1. INTRODUCTION
Historically, successful catch-up has been associated with both the adoption of existing products and techniques in established industries ‚Äì imitation ‚Äì and with innovation. If all countries below the technological frontier catch up, convergence will necessarily follow; on the other hand, if only some countries catch up, while others fall behind, then the outcome with respect to convergence is not clear.
Empirical studies have shown that convergence is limited only to groups of countries, or ‚Äòconvergence clubs‚Äô (Baumol, 1986). To illustrate this, Figure 1 presents differences in economic performance across countries, plotting growth in GDP per capita in the period 1980-2005 against its level at the beginning of the same period for the sample of 50 countries considered in this work. Then, four quadrants surge, in line with the terms coined by Abramovitz (1986): those countries with initial low per capita income and subsequent low growth that are ‚Äúfalling behind‚Äù from the rest; countries with high initial income per capita that had low growth during the following years,

which are considered to be ‚Äúlosing momentum‚Äù; initially poor countries that managed to grow fast, ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù with the developed countries; and initially rich countries that grew fast, ‚Äúmoving ahead‚Äù from the rest of the economies.
Then, it is central for economic growth analysis to explain the differences between the countries‚Äô growth rates through the conditions for successful catch-up; to be able to exploit technology, countries need to develop the necessary capabilities for doing so. But, what are those conditions or capabilities that firms, industries and countries need to develop in order to escape the low development trap? By using the methodologies followed by Archibugi and Coco (2005) and Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), the aim of this work is to study the role of capabilities in the national innovation systems of both developed and emerging countries, as well as their possible impact on economic growth.
An adequate quantification of current and lagged levels of technological and social capabilities is important to understand why some countries innovate and have a better economic performance than others. This work empirically identifies, through factor analysis, five dimensions of capabilities: technological capabilities, three central features of social capability ‚Äì following Abramovitz (1986): the political system, market freedom, and openness to international market ‚Äì and a common feature between technological and social capabilities: financing. A central finding of this study is that the development of technological capabilities is highly correlated with subsequent economic growth, but the returns inversely depend on the distance to the world technology frontier.
The remainder of this work proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses earlier studies on growth theory, catch-up, national innovation systems and capabilities, as well as studies that link the theoretical considerations of capabilities with empirical frameworks. Section 3 briefly lists the countries and indicators used in the empirical part of this study, as well as their link with the theoretical framework. Section 4 presents the results of factor analysis, as well as their economic interpretation and the relation between the resulting factors and economic growth. Section 5 compares both the statistical approach and the consistency of the technological capability measure found in this study to other existing indicators in the literature. In Section 6, a battery of econometric methods is used to further explore the relationship between both technological and social capabilities and economic growth. Finally, Section 7 concludes.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. FORMAL GROWTH THEORY
Over the 1950s and 1960s, the main focus of neoclassical economists was on the relationship among income distribution, capital accumulation and growth, not on technology. Neoclassical growth theory, as exhibited by Robert Solow‚Äôs model, assumes technology to be a public good, i.e. something that is available to everyone everywhere free of charge. Then, according to this theory, all countries share the same pool of technology.
Based on this idea of technology, and to allow for long-run growth in GDP per capita, Solow added an exogenous term called ‚Äútechnological progress‚Äù. Under this assumption, GDP per capita in all countries will grow at the same rate of technological progress in the long run. Therefore, differences in per capita growth across countries can only be explained by ‚Äútransitional dynamics‚Äù, due to disparities in the initial conditions.
Then, the long-run rate of growth is exogenously determined, and economies will supposedly always converge towards a steady state rate of growth that depends only on the common rate of technological progress, factor accumulation, and the rates of labour force growth and savings. Since empirical research showed that this approach explained little of the observed differences, researchers started to consider other explanatory variables, such as the existence of ‚Äútechnology gaps‚Äù across countries, implying another interpretation of technology as less public and less neutral.
On the other hand, empirical studies on economic growth over the 1950s and 1960s endeavoured to growth accounting, i.e. decomposing growth of GDP. But, in their attempts to identify the contribution from technology to economic growth and to better distinguish it from other sources, growth accountants were confronted by considerable struggles.
Abramovitz (1956) found a major part of productivity growth was explained by an unidentified total factor productivity (TFP) growth. This TFP factor was defined by Solow as a residual that describes empirical productivity growth ‚Äì widely known in the growth literature as the ‚ÄúSolow residual‚Äù ‚Äì since it is the part of growth that cannot be explained through capital accumulation or the accumulation of other traditional factors, such as labour or land.
5

Nevertheless, identifying TFP with technology became a main issue since it is not easy to disentangle factor accumulation from technological progress. Because of this, during the 1980s and 1990s the interest in the role of knowledge ‚Äì i.e. technology ‚Äì in economic growth raised, especially with the emergence of the ‚Äúnew growth theory‚Äù. This theory states that differences in economic growth and development across countries are the outcome of endogenous knowledge accumulation within borders. Besides, these models not only endogenise technological progress, but they also relate technological change to the underlying market structure. Contrary to neoclassical growth models, endogenous models imply that ‚Äúsmall differences in policies, technological opportunities or other characteristics of societies will lead to permanent differences in long-run growth rates‚Äù (Acemoglu, 2008, p. 435).
Therefore, according to this approach, long-run economic growth should be expected to depend on economic incentives to innovation, such as: strong intellectual property rights enforced by a robust legal system, supply of needed skills and financial availability. Additionally, Grossman and Helpman (1991) propose that openness to trade and foreign investment should be considered essential for countries to catch-up, since this might help them to overcome the disadvantages of scale. However, scale effects are not very plausible empirically and have been criticized by many authors.
2.2. CATCHING UP
Although neoclassical growth models predict that in the long run international growth rate differentials cannot exist, the economic history of the 20th century showed an increasing gap between rich and poor countries (Lucas, 1988). Due to these contradictions, a technology-gap approach started to develop within the economic growth debate.
Contrary to the traditional neoclassical theory, technology-gap theorists consider technological differences to be the prime source of cross-country differences in GDP per capita, with know-how embedded in organizational structures; this last consideration understands technology as less public, making it more difficult and costly to transfer (Fagerberg, 1994).
Catching up refers to the hypothesis that ‚Äúcountries with relatively low technological levels are able to exploit a backlog of existing knowledge and therefore attain high productivity growth rates, while countries that operate at (or near to) the technological frontier have less opportunities for
6

high productivity growth‚Äù (Verspagen, 1991, p. 359). In other words, it denotes the reduction of the gap in productivity between a leader country and a group of followers. Fagerberg (1994) argues catching-up is a post World War II phenomenon, since the gap in labour productivity between the United States and the mean of other fifteen industrialized countries has been shrinking since around 1950.
Then, theoretically, as Abramovitz and David state,
‚ÄúEconomic growth as we have known is not a balanced, steady-state affair in essence. [‚Ä¶] Rather, central features of the historical process of growth [‚Ä¶] may be viewed as part of a sequence of technologically induced traverses, disequilibrium transitions between successive growth paths‚Äù (Abramovitz & David, 1973, p. 429).
Several empirical studies that investigate the strength of the catching-up hypothesis conclude there is a strong negative correlation between growth rates and initial per capita income, but many authors show catching-up is not a global phenomenon. Baumol comes to the conclusion that ‚Äúrather than sharing in convergence, some of the poorest countries have also been growing most slowly‚Äù (Baumol, 1986, p. 1079); and De Long (1988) argued an ‚Äúex post selection bias‚Äù: the long-run convergence for the richest countries today doesn‚Äôt hold for the richest countries of the previous century.
Baumol, Batey and Wolff (1989) presented a simple model of cross-country growth including the potential for catch-up and education. After expanding the sample used by De Long to all countries for which data were available, the authors showed there is little support for convergence when all developing countries are included, and argued that convergence is confined to groups of countries, or ‚Äúconvergence clubs‚Äù, in specific time periods.
Then, the catch-up hypothesis regained significance, but conditional on educational efforts; out of this debate, Fagerberg deduces that ‚Äúa simple catch-up model with one independent variable is not sufficient to explain differences in growth‚Äù (Fagerberg, 1994, p. 1160). However, he claims that the rate of productivity growth of a follower also depends on other factors that differ across countries, apart from the gap in productivity, such as appropriate economic and institutional characteristics.
7

The first attempts to conceptualise this institutional notion were developed by the economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron in his 1962 book ‚ÄúEconomic backwardness in historical perspective‚Äù, with the study of relatively backward economies, such as Germany, France and Russia, during the 19th century.
Contrary to the Marxian generalisation, according to which it is the history of advanced industrial countries that traces out the path for development for the more backwarded countries, Gerschenkron stated that the development of a backward country might tend to differ fundamentally from that of an advanced one. Moreover, he proposed that, in a number of important historical illustrations, industrialisation processes in a backward country showed substantial ‚Äúdifferences in the speed and character of industrial development [that] were to a considerable extent the result of application of institutional instruments for which there was little or no counterpart in an established industrial country‚Äù (Gerschenkron, 1962, p. 7). The objective of these institutional instruments would be to mobilize resources to endeavour the necessary changes required by modern technology.
In accordance with Gerschenkron, the extent of the variation in industrial development depends directly on the ‚Äúnatural industrial potentialities‚Äù of these countries, such as their endowments of natural resources and certain institutional arrangements; certain ‚Äúnon-competitive‚Äù institutional arrangements, including long-term relationships between firms and banks, large firms and state interventions; and the degree of ‚Äúrelative backwardness‚Äù, seen as the backlog of technological innovations.
About this last point, he considered that applying the most modern and efficient techniques, through borrowed technology, was one of the main factors that could guarantee a high speed of development in a backward country entering the stage of industrialisation. Then, the institutions and policies that are appropriate to relatively backward countries should encourage investment and technology adoption, even if this comes with market rigidities and a less competitive environment (Acemoglu, Aghion, & Zilibotti, 2006).
Under the Gerschenkronian viewpoint, technology transfer is very demanding in terms of infrastructure; and market forces will be unlikely to succeed if left alone; then, some degree of active intervention by outsiders ‚Äì i.e. private or governmental organisations ‚Äì is necessary.
8

In this approach, firms are seen as key players, characterized by different combinations of intrinsic capabilities ‚Äì including technological know-how ‚Äì and strategies; and technological change is the result of both innovation and learning activities within organizations, and their interaction with their environments (Fagerberg, 1994).
Country-specific factors are assumed to affect the technological change process, in a sense that Nelson and Wright (1992) coined as ‚Äúnational technology‚Äù, with technologies having a different national character. Therefore, many authors consider countries as separate systems, each with its own dynamics and characteristics, calling them ‚Äúnational innovation systems‚Äù in the related literature.
With the nation as the centre of this analysis, the main assumption of this approach is that history, culture, language and institutions connect individuals, firms and organizations, with important consequences for technological progress. If this assumption loses its validity, this approach might miss its importance. Both the ‚Äúnational innovation systems‚Äù approach and the impact of globalisation in them are discussed in more detail in the next section.
2.3. NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS
The concept ‚Äúnational innovation systems‚Äù was first used by Christopher Freeman in his 1987 book ‚ÄúTechnology Policy and Economic Performance: Lessons from Japan‚Äù; this term includes ‚Äúall important economic, social, political, organizational, institutional, and other factors that influence the development, diffusion, and use of innovations‚Äù (Edquist, 2004, p. 183).
Considering the broad aspects on this approach, there is no single accepted definition of a national system of innovation, but there are some definitions that highlight most of the main characteristics involved in this approach (See Freeman [1987], Metcalfe [1995] and Nelson & Rosenberg [1993]). Based on these definitions, this work will consider national innovation systems as the set of interrelated institutions and organisations whose interactions and activities determine the creation, importation, modification and diffusion of new technologies.
According to the OECD (1997), this approach has gained importance thanks to three main factors: its recognition of the economic importance of knowledge, the increasing use of systems approaches, and the number of institutions involved in knowledge generation. I will explain these factors in more detail.
9

Economic importance of knowledge The national innovation systems approach focuses on the flows of technology and information among people, enterprises and institutions as key to the innovative process. Then, the study has focused on improving the performance in knowledge-based economies, defined as ‚Äúeconomies that are directly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge and information‚Äù (OECD, 1996, p.7). Since economic activities are increasingly knowledge-intensive, ‚Äúinvestments in knowledge, such as in R&D, education and training, and innovative work approaches are considered key to economic growth‚Äù (OECD, 1997, p.11).
Increasing use of systems approach The systems approach can be useful for the creation of theories about relations between specific variables; the use of this approach is opposed to the linear model of innovation, which considers new innovations and technologies as a direct result of ‚Äúscientific inputs‚Äù, where science is the originator of innovation. On the other hand, national innovation systems consider innovation as a result of the interaction between many actors, such as firms, universities and government agencies, with technical change as a result of ‚Äúfeedback loops‚Äù.
Edquist (2004) highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the systems of innovation. Among the strengths, he considers that this approach:
¬ßÔÇß Places innovation and learning processes at the centre of focus. ¬ßÔÇß Adopts a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective. ¬ßÔÇß Employs historical and evolutionary perspectives, making the notion of optimality
irrelevant. ¬ßÔÇß Emphasizes interdependence and non-linearity. ¬ßÔÇß Emphasizes the role of institutions.
On the other hand, among its weaknesses, he states the innovation systems approach ‚Äúis still associated with conceptual diffuseness‚Äù and that it doesn‚Äôt have a status as a formal theory, considering it instead an ‚Äúapproach‚Äù or a ‚Äúconceptual framework‚Äù, due to the relative absence of well-established empirical regularities.
10

Institutions involved in knowledge generation The policies and programs of national governments, the nation‚Äôs legal system and the existence of a shared culture and language, among other factors, define an ‚Äúinside and outside‚Äù that can affect technical advance. Furthermore, national boundaries and differences tend to define national innovation systems; then, each country has its own institutional profile.
Summing up this last idea, Nelson and Rosenberg use the term ‚Äútechnonationalism‚Äù, which combines ‚Äúa strong belief that the technological capabilities of a nation‚Äôs firms are a key source of their competitive prowess, with a belief that these capabilities are in a sense national, and can be built by national action‚Äù (Nelson & Rosenberg, 1993, p. 3). This ‚Äútechnonationalism‚Äù has raised the current strong interest in national innovation systems and in the scope and approach to which these national differences explain variations in national economic performance.
Although technological communities have become transnational thanks to globalisation, there still remain some striking disparities between systems of countries in comparable economic settings. These disparities are based in differences in national histories and cultures such as, for example, the timing of a country‚Äôs entry into the industrialisation process; then, these have shaped national institutions, laws and policies.
Despite the theoretical importance of this approach, there is no agreement on how it should be empirically studied. However, according to Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), there have been some attempts by trying to measure a country‚Äôs innovation system through the number of patents that its population generates; nevertheless, as Fagerberg (2006, p.11) points out, ‚Äúpatents reflect invention, not innovation‚Äù: for countries below the technology frontier ‚Äì such as developing countries ‚Äì most of their innovative activities would get unrecognized under this approach.
2.4. CAPABILITIES
In accordance with Gerschenkron, catch-up is not automatic, but the result of significant effort and institution building. Following this idea, over the next section a review will be made on the historical study of capabilities under different perspectives and terminologies, along with their
11

significance to economic activity, since they operationalize the Gerschenkronian hypothesis of appropriate economic and institutional characteristics.
2.4.1. SOCIAL CAPABILITY Abramovitz (1986) points out that the technological backwardness of a country not only depends on the level of technology embodied in its capital stock, but also in societal characteristics and the country‚Äôs past failure to achieve the level of productivity of more advanced countries. Following Ohkawa and Rosovsky (1973), Abramovitz calls these characteristics ‚Äúsocial capabilities‚Äù, which are collective competences related to ‚Äúwhat organizations in the private and public sectors are capable of doing and how this is supported (or hampered) by broader social and cultural factors‚Äù (Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008, p. 1418).
Abramovitz concerns with the notion of a trade-off between specialization and adaptability: The level of education in a country and the nature of its commercial, industrial and financial organizations might be well designed to capitalise the existing technology, but they may be less suitable to adapt to change. Nevertheless, technological opportunity might press for change, and countries can learn to modify their institutions. It is important to also take into consideration that social capabilities depend on more than education and the organization of firms: other aspects of economic systems count as well, such as a country‚Äôs openness to competition and the establishment and operation of new firms and goods.
Then, a country‚Äôs potential for high rates of economic growth is strong when it is ‚Äútechnologically backward but socially advanced‚Äù, as Abramovitz claims; and a country‚Äôs potentiality for productivity via catch-up can be defined by a combination of technological gap and social capability. Some aspects of social capability that he emphasized (Abramovitz, 1986; Abramovitz, 1994) are: technical competence ‚Äì measured as level of education; experience in the organization and management of large scale enterprises; financial institutions and markets capable of mobilizing capital on a large scale; honesty and trust; and the stability of government and its effectiveness in defining and enforcing rules, and supporting economic growth (Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008).
12

2.4.2. TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY Intrigued by South Korea‚Äôs rise from being one of the poorest countries in the world to an industrialised powerhouse in only four decades and following Cohen and Levinthal‚Äôs viewpoint, Linsu Kim developed the book ‚ÄúImitation to innovation: The dynamics of Korea‚Äôs technological learning‚Äù. In the introduction chapter, he coined the term ‚Äútechnological capability‚Äù, which refers to ‚Äúthe ability to make effective use of technological knowledge in efforts to assimilate, use, adapt and change existing technologies‚Äù (Kim, 1997, p. 4).
The definition of technological capabilities by Kim is quite similar to that of ‚Äòabsorptive capacity‚Äô by Cohen and Levinthal (1990), and Kim (1997) uses the two concepts interchangeably. But, unlike Cohen and Levinthal, Kim identifies three elements in the technological capability: ¬ßÔÇß Production capability, which refers to numerous technological capabilities required to operate
and maintain production facilities; ¬ßÔÇß Investment capability, that are the abilities required for expanding capacity and establishing
new production facilities; and, ¬ßÔÇß Innovation capability, that consists of abilities to create and carry new technological
possibilities through to economic practice.
2.5. EMPIRICAL STUDIES
Due to the difficulty faced when trying to link the theoretical and the empirical approaches, only a few empirical works on the role of capabilities in economic growth were found. Nevertheless, these works present a suitable approach to the study of this area and will be reviewed closely. Table 2 summarizes the comparative analysis of these empirical studies.
2.5.1. ADELMAN & MORRIS (1965) Adelman and Morris analyse the socio-political and institutional influences upon economic growth to gain more precise empirical knowledge about the extent and nature of interdependence of economic and noneconomic aspects of the growth process. To do so, the techniques of factor analysis were applied to GNP per capita income and 22 indicators reflecting the social and political structure of 74 less-developed countries in the period 1957-1962. The results of this
13

analysis showed that two thirds of inter-country variations in the level of economic growth are associated with differences in noneconomic characteristics.
As the authors suggest, the results of the factor analysis don‚Äôt demonstrate that economic growth is caused by socio-political transformations, and neither indicate that variations in development levels determine patterns of social and political change; rather, they suggest the existence of ‚Äúa systematic pattern of interaction among mutually interdependent economic, social and political forces, all of which combine to generate a unified complex of change in the style of life of a community‚Äù (Adelman & Morris, 1965, p. 557).
Taking advantage on the fact that factor analysis can use a relatively large number of intercorrelated variables as data inputs, Adelman and Morris used a broad selection of indicators reflecting: social characteristics, to depict important aspects of social changes associated with urbanisation and industrialisation; political indicators, to summarize leading aspects of the growth of modern nation states; and other characteristics, such as the quality and orientation of political administration and leadership; and the importance of key interest groups within the nation.
The procedures used in defining indicators and in ranking countries differed for various types of country characteristics, with three categories distinguished: 1, those for which classification could be based only on published statistics; 2, those for which it was necessary to combine statistical and qualitative elements; and 3, those which were purely qualitative in nature. These last categories show the problem researchers faced during those years due to the lack of available and reliable statistical databases.
Once the classification of countries ‚Äì according to various characteristics ‚Äì was completed, each of the 74 less-developed countries was given a letter score according to the American grading system, going from A+ to D-, with respect to the 22 social and political indicators, that were converted to a linear system going from 100 (maximum value) to 0 (minimum value).
Out of this statistical analysis, the authors identified four factors: ¬ßÔÇß Factor I may be interpreted to represent the ‚Äúprocesses of change in attitudes and institutions
associated with the breakdown of traditional social organisation‚Äù. Levels of economic development are closely associated with the degree of specialisation and integration of social
14

structure, with the rise of the middle class identified as an essential feature to the creation of an institutional framework favourable to economic change. ¬ßÔÇß Factor II describes variations among countries in political systems. The coefficients resulting from the factor analysis indicate that a typically Western configuration of political traits is generally associated with higher average income. ¬ßÔÇß Factor III is related to ‚Äúthe character of leadership and the nature of leadership strategies‚Äù, with two extreme considerations: at one end are leaders with strong attachment to the preservation of a traditional society, against the ones that are intensely nationalistic and committed to industrialisation and state direction. ¬ßÔÇß Factor IV shows a positive relation between per capita GNP and social and political stability, implying the absence of social tensions and political instability is a prerequisite for sustained economic growth.
Additionally, the authors developed similar regional studies, with Africa, Latin America, and Near and Far East as objects of study. Their results support the findings of the over-all analysis and show that
‚ÄúThe role of social aspects of the industrialisation-urbanisation process is overwhelmingly important for low income economies in which the absorptive capacity is sharply limited by the inhibiting nature of the social structure‚Äù (Adelman & Morris, 1965, p. 577).
Their pioneering methodology to study the effect of non-economic variables in economic growth and development opened a new line of investigation in economics. However, choosing a numerical scale for qualitative scales is somehow an arbitrary decision; and, due to the lack of data that authors faced, there could be several measurement biases that needed to be considered.
2.5.2. TEMPLE & JOHNSON (1998) Temple and Johnson introduce this paper by claiming researchers sought the origins of long-run growth in the wrong places, neglecting the role of social capabilities in economic growth. To address this, they show that the index of socioeconomic development constructed by Adelman and Morris (1968) could have helped researchers to make better forecasts of long-run growth rates; they do so by gathering enough evidence that fast growth is partly the outcome of favourable social arrangements. Nevertheless, Temple and Johnson use Adelman and Morris‚Äô data without
15

taking advantage of the increase of available statistical information to correct their arbitrary measurement of qualitative variables.

After analysing Adelman and Morris‚Äô work, the authors highlight the close relation between social development ‚Äì represented by a social development index, or SOCDEV ‚Äì and income per capita. Although the relation of causality is uncertain, they argue that a higher level of social development is likely to be reflected in higher investment and lower population growth, and economic development brings widespread social changes. Besides, the authors consider that ‚Äúhigher levels of socioeconomic development are associated with higher investment rates in physical and human capital, with more productive investments, or with a greater ability to assimilate technology from abroad‚Äù.

After this, they examine the direct effect of social arrangements on growth, acting through total factor productivity. To study this, they work with a standard regression specification based on Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992):

Estimates of this equation suggest that the Adelman and Morris index is a useful predictor of subsequent growth performance, even when subsequent information ‚Äì such as investment, schooling and population growth ‚Äì is used; however, the direct effect of this index is not so strong when regional dummies are included. After these results, authors suggest SOCDEV is a robust determinant of economic growth, with its effect operated partly via total factor productivity (TFP) growth.

16

Nevertheless, some criticised that the construction of the Adelman and Morris index only captured partially the notion of social capability, and that it failed to show why society might matter, since it used only a range of economic and social variables that didn‚Äôt measure the theoretical construction of social capability. To address these criticisms, Temple and Johnson concentrate on just five of the indicators that Adelman and Morris used to construct their index. They found that one of them, the extent of mass communications in the early 1960s ‚Äì based upon a composite index of newspapers in circulation and radios in use ‚Äì has a particularly strong correlation with subsequent growth, and seems to have a direct effect on total factor productivity growth as well as on factor accumulation, even after testing for robustness.
2.5.3. ARCHIBUGI & COCO (2005) In this article, Archibugi and Coco compare the methodologies and results of six measures of national technological capabilities provided by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNDO), the World Bank (WB) and the RAND Corporation; along with Archibugi and Coco‚Äôs own measure of technological capability, ArCo.
Filling the need of new and improved measures of technological capabilities on the performance of nations to understand economic and social transformations, these organisations and researchers have developed indicators and measures, taking advantage on the improvement of statistical sources and tools.
Archibugi and Coco (2005) hold that the notion of national innovation systems ‚Äúrequires identifying the qualitative as well as the quantitative differences across countries‚Äù and that it assumes each national system is the result of a large number of institutions and of geographical components. However, measuring technological capabilities is more complicated than other economic and social indicators, due to the heterogeneous nature of the different components of technology.
Relating to the nature of technology, the authors consider the measurement of technological capabilities should not only include indicators of the generation of inventions and innovations, but also of their application and dissemination; and it is assumed that the various components of technological capabilities are complements, not substitutes.
17

The five measures of technological capability analysed in this work, and summarised in Table 1, are:
¬ßÔÇß The WEF Technology Index developed by the World Economic Forum. It includes three main categories of technology for 102 countries: innovative capacity, ICT diffusion and technology transfer. An important consideration of this index is that it uses an asymmetric measurement of technology ‚Äì giving a lower weight to the indicators of innovative capacity ‚Äì since many countries derive competences from technology use and imitation, rather that production and innovation.
¬ßÔÇß The UNDP Technology Achievement Index, reported in the Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Here, authors consider four dimensions of technology achievement for 84 countries: creation of technology, diffusion of newest technologies, diffusion of oldest technologies and human skills.
¬ßÔÇß The ArCo Technological Capabilities Index (ArCo), developed by Archibugi and Coco in their 2004 article ‚ÄúA New Indicator of Technological Capabilities for Developed and Developing Countries (ArCo)‚Äù, analysing 162 countries and taking into account four dimensions of technology: innovative activity, technology infrastructure, human capital and import technology. This fourth component is an important contribution to the literature, since it is based on the assumption that ‚Äúan important source of technological capabilities is also represented by the possibility of a country to access technology developed elsewhere‚Äù (Archibugi & Coco, 2005).
¬ßÔÇß The Industrial Development Scoreboard, from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), that collects a group of indicators for 87 countries under four categories: technological effort, competitive industrial performance, technology performance and technology imports. It is important to highlight this scoreboard does not produce a synthetic indicator, due to the scepticism towards the compression of many variables into a single measure.
¬ßÔÇß The Science and Technology Capacity Index (STCI), by the RAND Corporation, for a set of 76 countries with eight indicators aggregated into three categories: enabling factors, resources and embedded technology. In this index, the outcome depends on the weights assigned each category, which is an important disadvantage to consider.

After comparing the ranking of countries of each measure, authors conclude only a few significant differences emerge. The similarities under each approach reflect certain consensus on the nature of technology, despite the differences in the availability of statistical data.
One of the main considerations of this paper is that none of these attempts have tried to weigh and combine the various components using a statistical technique, such as factor or principal component analysis; instead, each author has decided the relative importance of every component of technological capabilities, leaving this as an arbitrary decision.

2.5.4. FAGERBERG & SRHOLEC (2008)
In this paper, Fagerberg and Srholec (2008) empirically analyse the capabilities needed to succeed in economic growth, following Adelman and Morris (1965, 1967), and Temple and Johnson (1998), by using factor analysis on 25 indicators for 115 countries from the 1992-2004 period to determine the most important elements among the various indicators used.
The analysis leads to the selection of four factors ‚Äì that jointly explain 74% of the total variance ‚Äì as the different dimensions of capabilities:
‚Ä¢ Factor I, called ‚Äúdevelopment of innovation system‚Äù since it loads highly on several indicators associated with ‚Äútechnological capability‚Äù: patenting, scientific publications, ICT infrastructure, ISO 9000 certifications and access to finance. It is important to highlight that it also correlates highly with education, which is the main measure of social capabilities, emphasizing the importance of education for both capabilities. The correlation between this factor and the log of GDP per capita is very high, 86%,
‚Ä¢ Factor II, coined ‚Äúquality of governance‚Äù, loads highly with aspects related to a wellfunctioning judicial system, little corruption and a favourable environment for business. Although its correlation with the log of GDP per capita is high, with 57%, it is not as strong as the first factor.
‚Ä¢ Factor III loads high on indicators reflecting the ‚Äúcharacter of the political system‚Äù. As Fagerberg and Srholec point out, ‚Äúcountries with political systems that are close to those of the Western world, rank high on this dimension, while countries with systems that differ from Western democratic ideals, get a low mark‚Äù. However, this trait is not closely correlated with levels of development, with distinctly authoritarian regimes doing rather well economically.
‚Ä¢ Factor IV correlates highly with only two indicators: imports of goods and services, and foreign direct investments. Then, it is called ‚Äúdegree of openness of the economy‚Äù. Although this is a factor deemed by the ‚Äúnew growth theory‚Äù, it does not correlate with economic growth, irrespective of whether country size is controlled for or not.
Simple correlations might hide more complex relationships; subsequently, Fagerberg and Srholec explore cross-country differences in capabilities to try to understand countries‚Äô economic growth. Authors perform a multivariate regression of the four capabilities identified and the GDP per capita; and, in addition to the capabilities already mentioned, they include a set of indicators
20

reflecting differences in geography, nature and history. Besides the ordinary least squares estimate, they test for robustness with iteratively reweighted least squares and, to identify the specification with the best statistical properties, authors use a (backward) stepwise regression. The empirical analysis suggests that, in order to succeed in catch up, a well-developed innovation system is necessary. Among their findings, authors realize that factors related to geography, nature and history debilitate the development of a well-working innovation system. Besides, they find that the political system ‚Äì and what they call ‚Äúthe degree of westernization‚Äù ‚Äì has a diametrically opposite effect in poor and rich economies: a significantly negative effect turns to a significantly positive impact when only the richest half is included; this might be explained with the degree of diversity among the poor countries in how their economies work, or with a measurement problem. Finally, authors find that the argument that differences in openness matter much for development is quite weak, which is consistent with the findings of Rodrik et al (2004). This result doesn‚Äôt hold when a robust regression technique to test for the impact of outliers ‚Äì iteratively reweighted least squares ‚Äì is applied, with changes in openness over time having a modest positive effect in economic growth. Fagerberg and Srholec conclude ‚Äúthe picture that emerges from this study is one of a global knowledge-based economy with strong elements of endogenous growth‚Äù and that ‚Äúcountries that succeed in developing and sustaining strong innovation capabilities and well-functioning systems of governance do well economically while those that fail tend to fall behind‚Äù (Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008, p. 1427).

3. SELECTION OF COUNTRIES AND INDICATORS
3.1. SELECTION OF COUNTRIES
Since the aim of this work is to study the role of capabilities in the economic growth of both developed and emerging countries, a selection of countries was done considering that coverage on both time and country was available. Unlike Fagerberg & Srholec (2008), this study focuses on the role of social and technological capabilities in developed and emerging countries, with the special consideration of the role of research and development expenditure in their technological capabilities and subsequent economic growth. To do so, the screening was narrowed to a selection of 50 countries:
¬ßÔÇß OECD members, considered high-income countries with high development, and are regarded as high-income economies. 33 out of 34 members ‚Äì Luxembourg was excluded ‚Äì were considered: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States.
¬ßÔÇß Emerging countries, considered nations with social or economic activity in the process of rapid growth and industrialisation. This study considers the 23 countries in the IMF list of emerging countries (some of them are also OECD members): Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Estonia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Ukraine.
3.2. SELECTION OF INDICATORS
Following Fagerberg and Srholec‚Äôs (2008) methodology, a broad selection of indicators for the economic, social and political structures of the fifty countries was considered for this study, with indicators expressed as three-year-averages over two periods: an initial one, 1992‚Äì1994, and a final one, 2002‚Äì2004, following the existing growth literature. These periods were chosen due to data availability, although a broader period would be more suitable for economic growth analysis. Besides, some data was missing, so it had to be estimated using information on other countries, years and indicators.
23

Based on the notions of ‚Äòsocial capability‚Äô (Abramovitz, 1986), ‚Äòtechnological capability‚Äô (Kim, 1997) and ‚Äòabsorptive capacity‚Äô (Cohen & Levinthal, 1989), and in the measures of technological capabilities analysed by Archibugi and Coco (2005), an overview of the indicators chosen to measure these aspects is presented. Appendix A presents a brief overview of definitions, sources and coverage of the indicators used.
3.2.1. INDICATORS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY The generation of technology and innovation, captured by the ‚Äòinnovation capability‚Äô of countries, as Kim coined it, can be measured in several ways. This study takes into consideration four aspects of science, research and innovation: research and development (R&D) expenditure, patents, scientific publications and international production quality standards.
R&D expenditure measures the resources used in the generation of new products and processes; besides, R&D intensities can be compared across countries by taking into account the R&D/GDP ratio, and is nuclear to new growth theory models as a source of economic growth, as Cohen and Levinthal (1989) have stated in their ‚Äòabsorptive capacity‚Äô concept. Nevertheless, due to the lack of data for most countries, it hasn‚Äôt been considered for empirical analysis on the role of capabilities. However, all countries considered in this study have available information on R&D expenditure for the period of time studied in this analysis, and it will be considered as a variable to study technological capabilities.
Although patents and scientific articles have been considered as measures of invention, not innovation, they are taken as good proxies of technology creation in a country. However, it is important to take into account that both indicators present variations in quality and sectorial distributions that vary from country to country. To avoid problems of measurement consistency, this work will only take into account patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and scientific publications covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).
Since it is widely argued in the national innovation systems literature that scale effects can be reverted through openness to international markets, which may also enable technology transfer, two channels of international technology transfer are taken into account to measure openness: trade and foreign direct investment, measured through merchandise imports and the foreign direct
24

investment inward stock, respectively. To avoid country-size bias, and following Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), both indicators were measured orthogonal to country size, by regressing them on the log of land area and taking the residuals as new measures.
In order to capture the ‚Äòproduction capability‚Äô (Kim, 1997) and following Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), this study considers the adoption of quality management systems through the number of firms in the country with ISO 9000 certifications, since ‚Äúit is increasingly seen as a requirement for firms supplying high quality markets, and is [‚Ä¶] likely to reflect a high emphasis on quality in production‚Äù (Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008, p. 1420).
To measure technology diffusion, three indicators of information and communications technologies (ICT) were chosen: fixed and mobile phone subscribers, Internet users and personal computers. It is important to highlight that these measures may also capture the current extent of mass communications, which was a strong predictor of subsequent economic growth in Adelman and Morris‚Äô analysis.
Finally, on the frontier between technological and social capabilities, we find two main aspects: financing and human capital. Gerschenkron argued on the importance of the financial system to mobilize resources for catching-up, and Abramovitz discussed the significance of highly skilled population also to catch-up. To take into account both viewpoints, this work considers the amount of domestic credit to private sector and the capitalization of companies listed in national capital markets for the financing aspect; and the rates of enrolment in secondary and tertiary education as human capital indicators.
3.2.2. INDICATORS OF SOCIAL CAPABILITY As seen in the previous literature review, it is widely emphasised in the national innovation systems literature that technological advances in industry are significantly influenced by several external factors resulting in specific innovation systems. As it was reviewed before, Abramovitz considered social capabilities to depend on more than technical competence ‚Äì measured as level of education ‚Äì and the organization of firms; instead, other aspects of economic systems count as well, such as: a country‚Äôs openness to competition; the establishment and stability of government; its effectiveness in defining and enforcing rules, as well as supporting economic growth.
25

To take into account empirically these social and cultural factors considered in Abramovitz‚Äôs ‚Äòsocial capability‚Äô, this study tries to capture both the importance of institutions and the effectiveness of law enforcement through indicators that measure the type of political system and government attitudes toward markets. To estimate the type of political system, six indicators commonly used in the political science and institutional literature (Acemoglu & Johnson, 2005; Rodrik, Subramanian, & Trebbi, 2004) were chosen: the degree of democracy (vs. autocracy); the extent of separation of powers; the competitiveness of elections into both executive and legislative branches of government; and the degree of both political rights and civil liberties. On the other hand, to line out government attitudes toward markets, three indicators were chosen: the degree of protection and enforcement of property rights, since Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) showed that the property rights enforcement has a deeper effect in economic growth than contracting institutions; the ease to open and operate a business, which can be considered a measure of the government attitude towards enterprises and the entry barriers imposed to new businesses; and the perception of corruption among the population, as a measure of informal markets in the economy.

4. FACTOR ANALYSIS
Following Adelman and Morris (1965), Temple and Johnson (1998), and Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), this study uses factor analysis to capture the capabilities underneath the indicators, since it can utilise a relatively large number of intercorrelated variables as data inputs and detect a smaller number of factors or variables. The methodology followed for factor analysis is taken from Fagerberg and Srholec (2008).

Notes: Five factors with eigenvalue>1 were detected, explaining 77.4% of total variance. Extraction method: principal-component factors. Rotation: oblimin oblique. Number of observations = 100 (pooled data for 50 countries in the initial and final period). Source: See Appendix A.

Factor analysis is ‚Äúthe attempt, based on statistical observations, to determine the quantitative relationships between variables where the relationships are due to separate conditioning factors or general causal factors‚Äù (Schilderinck, 1970, p. IX). It is based on the assumption that there are a
27

number of general causal factors that give rise to the various relationships between the variables under examination. Unlike all measures analysed by Archibugi and Coco (2005), factor analysis assigns weights to each variable depending on its interaction with all variables considered in the study.
An important consideration to highlight is that the pooled data ‚Äì formed with the sample of 100 observations obtained from the pooled data for 50 countries in both initial and final periods ‚Äì was standardised1, so that changes in a variable over time can be interpreted as changes in both the country‚Äôs relative position and the indicator‚Äôs relative importance. Results of factor analysis after rotation are summarised in the matrix of common factor coefficients presented in Table 3.
The extraction method was principal-component factors, in which an orthogonal transformation is made to convert the set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of principal components. After the extraction, an oblimin oblique rotation was applied to get a clearer pattern. Under this specification, one assumes that factors are correlated, as the theoretical literature relates, and the loadings represent how each of the variables are weighted for each factor.
To determine the number of factors chosen for the analysis, the Kaiser criterion and the scree plot test were used. The Kaiser criterion suggests that only those factors whose eigenvalue is greater than one should be retained, being this value equal to the information that is accounted for by an average single entry. On the other hand, the scree plot graphs each factor on the X-axis against its corresponding eigenvalue on the Y-axis. Since the first factor loading is the one with the highest variance ‚Äì and, thus, the highest eigenvalue ‚Äì and the next ones are in decreasing order, the scree plot test states that when the drop ends and the curve forms an elbow shape, the remaining factors after the one starting the elbow should be dropped.
Finally, after these considerations, five factors are retained for this study. Unlike Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), that only retain four factors, the results of the factor analysis in this study got an additional factor that loaded highly on those indicators related to the financing of the private sector, apart from the technological capabilities. A major advantage of this result is that the analysis of the financing sector in economic growth can be done separately, and permits the proper identification of technological capabilities as a factor, unlike Fagerberg and Srholec that label this
1 A standardized variable is a variable that has been rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. To do so, first the mean is subtracted from the value for each case, resulting in a mean of zero. Then, the difference
28

factor as the ‚Äúinnovation system‚Äù of the country. And, contrasting the remaining factors with the results of Adelman and Morris (1965) and Temple and Johnson (1998) on social capabilities, a good result of this study is that the different components of social capabilities are not retained in only one factor, so the effects of the components can be analysed separately.
The interpretation of factor loadings may be easier in terms of the squares of the entries in the factor matrix. Each (Ì†µÌ±é!")! represents the proportion of the total unit variance of variable Ì†µÌ±ñ explained by factor Ì†µÌ±ó. Examining the first row of Table 3, it can be seen that (0.816)2 = 0.6659, (-0.066)2 = 0.00004, (-0.055)2 = 0.00003, (0.187)2 = 0.035, and (-0.231)2 = 0.0533. Then, 66.59% of inter-country variations in R&D expenditure are explained by Factor I, an additional 0.004% by Factor II, only 0.003% by Factor III, 3.5% by Factor IV, and the net contribution of Factor V is 5.33%.
The last column of the table indicates the sum of the squares of the factor loadings for each indicator. This ‚Äúcommunality‚Äù indicates the proportion of the total unit variance explained by all common factors together, and is analogous to Ì†µÌ±Ö! in regression analysis. The communality of R&D expenditure, for example, is:
0.816 2+ -0.066 2+ -0.055 2+ 0.187 2+ -0.231 2=0.742 ¬†
That is, 74.2% of inter-country variations in R&D expenditure are associated with the five common factors extracted from the 22 variables considered in this analysis. In addition to indicating the weight of each factor in explaining the observed variables, this factor loadings matrix provides the basis for grouping the variables into common factors. Then, each variable may be assigned to that factor in which it has the highest loading; and, when loadings of a variable in two factors are very close, the variable is assigned to the one with which it might have the closest relationship.
When the variables are assigned to common factors, then a theoretical interpretation of the factors has to be done, by giving a reasonable explanation of the underlying forces that they might represent. Therefore, we shall proceed to identify the factors specified in the results of this analysis.
Factor I: Technological capabilities
29

Indicators that have their highest loadings in Factor I reflect the innovation (R&D expenditure, patents, science and engineering articles), production (ISO 9000 certifications) and diffusion (mobile and fixed phone lines, Internet users, personal computers) of new technologies, as well as the human capital stock (secondary and tertiary school enrolment) of these countries. Then, according to the literature analysed previously, this factor portrays the ‚Äòtechnological capability‚Äù (Archibugi & Coco, 2005; Kim, 1997) of countries. Hence, Factor I was labelled as ‚ÄúTechnological capability‚Äù. Figure 2 shows there is a strong correlation between GDP per capita and the factor scores on technological capability, with deviations from the regression line coming from those countries whose technological capabilities are lower than their GDP per capita levels, most of them emerging market countries.
Factor II: Political system Figure 2: GDP per capita and technological capabilities (averages over 2002-2004)
R2 = 0.773
30

Factor II loads particularly high on indicators that reflect the type of political system: the index of democracy, where the lowest score is for countries ruled by an autocracy; the political constraint for an actor by its own to lead a change in government policy; the competitiveness of elections in both executive and legislative branches of government; and the measures of political rights and civil liberties that citizens of the country are able to exercise. These are all indicators that describe variations among countries in political system. Then, Factor II was labelled ‚ÄúPolitical system‚Äù. As Abramovitz (1986) stated, an important part of social capabilities was the stability of government, which derived in the country‚Äôs capacity to maintain social and political stability. In particular, the pattern of relations indicated in Factor II is strongly suggestive of broad historical and contemporary differences between the political organisation of the countries of Western Europe and North America and those of the rest of the world. The main result obtained from Figure 3 is that countries with higher GDP per capita also have higher scores on western democratic political systems, contrary to countries like China, known for
Figure 3: GDP per capita and type of political system (averages over 2002-2004)
R2 = 0.35
31

its socialist single-party state and lack of civil liberties and political rights. Then, an increase in this factor may be interpreted to represent a movement along a scale that ranges from centralized authoritarian political forms to Western-type systems. The coefficients resulting from the factor analysis indicate that a typically Western configuration of political traits is generally associated with higher average income. Nevertheless, many emerging countries in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia are located below the regression line, indicating that although having a western political system, their standards of living do not go accordingly. Factor III: Market freedom The third factor loads high on those aspects that reflect the government‚Äôs attitude towards markets: The degree to which a country‚Äôs laws protect private property rights and the enforcement of those laws, the degree of regulation in the opening and operation of a business, and the perceptions of people with regard to the extent of corruption. In other words, this factor loads high on indicators reflecting market freedom. Then, Factor III was labelled ‚ÄúMarket freedom‚Äù. Market freedom also plays an important role in the social capability of a country, since it considers
Figure 4: GDP per capita and market freedom (averages over 2002-2004)
R2 = 0.08
32

the government‚Äôs effectiveness in defining and enforcing rules, especially property rights. This also includes intellectual property rights, which is an important factor for new growth theory, since they are essential as entry conditions in the research sector. This factor can also be considered as a measure of ‚Äúinclusive institutions‚Äù (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). Inclusive institutions are designed to create incentives that reward everyone for hard work and innovation. If an entrepreneur assumes the government will not challenge monopolies that unfairly rule out competition, then he won‚Äôt invest his savings to develop new technology. Figure 4 shows that the composite variable based on this factor does not correlate with average income. It is important to highlight the relative position of a group of high-income and highly developed countries, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Belgium and New Zealand, that got some of the lowest scores on market freedom for this sample
Figure 5: GDP per capita and financing (averages over 2002-2004).
R2 = 0.02
33

Factor IV: Financing Gerschenkron (1962) highlighted the importance of solid financial institutions and markets for a country‚Äôs social capability, in order to mobilize capital on a large scale. Factor IV loads highly in only two indicators: domestic credit to private sector and market capitalization of listed companies. Then, this factor can be identified and labelled as ‚ÄúFinancing‚Äù, reflecting the country‚Äôs capacity to attract, mobilise and utilise financial resources to the private sector. Examining the factor analysis results from Table 3, an interesting result comes up: indicators of the ‚Äúfinancing‚Äù factor also load highly on the ‚Äútechnological capability‚Äù composite variable, which is consistent with the growth and capabilities theory analysed before, since financing is on the frontier of both technological and social capabilities. Figure 5 shows that the composite variable based on this factor does not correlate with average income. Factor V: Openness New growth theory argues that scale effects can be reverted by a country‚Äôs openness to Figure 6: GDP per capita and openness to international markets (averages over 2002-2004)
R2 = 0.002
34

international markets, and that this last consideration is essential for countries to catch-up (Grossman & Helpman, 1991). Factor V loads highly in only two indicators: merchandise imports and inward foreign direct investment; and, since these are considered measures of a country‚Äôs openness to international trade and capital, Factor V was labelled ‚ÄúOpenness‚Äù. Despite the theoretical conclusions, the correlation between average income and the factor scores on openness is almost non-existent, as Figure 6 shows; with two developed countries, Japan and Ireland, in both extremes of the openness scale: the first is considered a closed economy, and the latter as a highly economically integrated. It is important to remind that this result comes up even when country size was controlled for both merchandise imports and inward FDI.

5. COMPARISON OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES INDICATORS
Since a possible measure of technological capabilities is obtained from the previous factor analysis, it is important to compare both the statistical approach and the consistency of this measure to other existing technological capabilities in the literature.
To do so, this section follows the methodology developed by Archibugi and Coco (2005) and considers four existing measures of ‚Äòtechnological capabilities‚Äô, already explained in Section 2.5.3 and compared in Table 1: The WEF Technology Index, developed by the World Economic Forum; the UNDP Technology Achievement Index, reported in the Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP); the ArCo Technological Capabilities Index (ArCo), developed by Archibugi and Coco in their 2004 article ‚ÄúA New Indicator of Technological Capabilities for Developed and Developing Countries (ArCo)‚Äù; the Science and Technology Capacity Index (STCI), by the RAND Corporation; along with the measure developed in the previous factor analysis on this study, which will be labelled as ‚ÄúTechCap‚Äù from now on.
5.1. COMPONENTS AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES
After analysing the components used to construct each measure, we find several similarities and differences, in terms of the definitions and theoretical considerations made by Kim (1997), Cohen and Levinthal (1990), and Archibugi and Coco (2004, 2005).
First, all four measures use patents as an indicator of a country‚Äôs ‚Äòinnovative capacity‚Äô; even though patents are a measure of invention, not innovation, this is the best proxy one can find in the existing literature; but, unlike this study‚Äôs ‚ÄòTechCap‚Äô measure, that is not the case for R&D expenditure and science and engineering articles: R&D expenditure is only considered in the RAND index, while scientific articles are only included in both ArCo and RAND indexes. It is important to highlight that a measure of the ‚Äòproduction capability‚Äô (Kim, 1997) is only considered in this study, whereas none of the other measures considered this feature.
Then, in terms of technology diffusion, all four approaches use indicators of information and communication technologies: all four indexes include telephone lines ‚Äì both mobile and fixed ‚Äì and Internet users; but only the WEF index includes personal computers. Finally, all indexes incorporate indicators of human capital: WEF and RAND consider only tertiary enrolment, while ArCo includes tertiary enrolment, years of schooling and literacy rate.
36

By comparing the statistical approaches used to aggregate the three existing measures with the TechCap methodology, we find a central difference: the three indicators of technological capabilities used simple or weighted means of their components to aggregate them, whereas this study weighed the components with factor analysis. Thus, the relative importance of each component relies on the methodology itself, instead of the author‚Äôs consideration.
5.2. RANKING COMPARISON
Since the diverse methodologies used to construct the indexes do not allow comparisons of absolute values, we can compare the ranking of countries to verify the consistency of results. First, this section compares the position of individual countries and the changes among indexes. To do so, Table 4 examines the rankings provided by the four indexes, with the last two columns showing the rank mean and standard deviation for each country. One can observe that the standard deviation ‚Äì as a measure of the divergences at the country level ‚Äì rises in countries placed in the middle of the table.

High divergence can be better understood when considering the indicators used by each measure, e.g. WEF uses survey data, that doesn‚Äôt capture structural characteristics, but subjective perceptions. Then, one can expect different results from the other measures. Also, it is visible that countries from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia have higher standard deviations, meaning possibly that the gathering of technology-related information in those countries is not as accurate as in developed countries. Finally, it is also important to

emphasize that all emerging countries are at the bottom of the list. This result, combined with

Figure 1, might imply that higher technological capabilities are associated with higher average

income. A further examination of this result, using regression analysis, will be made over the next

section.

Now, we can focus on the similarity between rankings, using rank (Spearman) correlation analysis. Table 5 shows the rank correlation matrix among the 50 countries used in this study for the four measures of technological capabilities considered. It becomes evident that the TechCap measure obtained from factor analysis in this study, along with the ArCo index developed by Archibugi and Coco (2004), are the measures that get a higher mean correlation with the other measures. It is important to also emphasize the high rank correlation (0.96) between these two measures, since the ArCo index is the only other indicator that explicitly measures technological capabilities, despite both indicators using different indicators to measure this type of capability.
From Table 4, it is easy to note that divergence grows as one moves to the middle-bottom of the

table. To make a further inspection of this result, the 50-countries sample is divided in two subsamples: the top 25 countries (ordered by rank mean), which will be considered ‚Äúleaders‚Äù on technological capabilities; and the bottom 25 countries, called ‚Äúlatecomers‚Äù. Results of this analysis are displayed on Table 6. A clear result is that ‚Äúlatecomers‚Äù have a lower correlation among the different indexes, showing a high polarization of the values among countries in the top and the bottom of the sample. Nevertheless, the highest correlation between indexes is still between TechCap and ArCo (0.86 in both sub-samples), with the former loading higher values with all other indexes than any other indicator, which makes it a consistent measure of technological capabilities. Then, despite using a different statistical approach, the technological capabilities factor of this study, TechCap, is consistent with other existing measures in the literature.

6. REGRESSION ANALYSIS
An important application of the previous findings in this study is to allow the investigation of the role played by capabilities in economic growth. Following Fagerberg & Srholec‚Äôs (2008) methodology, the subsequent analysis uses a battery of econometric methods to explore this relationship, using GDP per capita (constant 2000, PPP in US dollars) as a proxy for economic growth.
In addition to the five capabilities previously identified, and following other empirical studies on economic growth in the literature (Acemoglu & Johnson, 2005; Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008; Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 2004; Rodrik, Subramanian, & Trebbi, 2004; Sachs, 2001), a set of control variables for history, geography and culture are included: longitude and latitude, surface area, access to ocean, land in desert and tropical zones, population density, ethnic and religion fractionalization, malaria fatal risk, oil deposits per capita, number of killed inhabitants in natural disasters and years since national independence. Appendix A gives a brief description of all indicators and their sources.

Also, two considerations are specified: to avoid a possible simultaneity bias, this section uses data for capabilities from the initial period (1992-1994), and the log of GDP per capita for the final period (2002-2004); besides, to elude the problem of comparison between coefficients due to differences in units of measure, beta coefficients are reported.
Results from the regression analysis are displayed in Table 7. Columns 1-5 show that the lagged values of the composite factors for technological capabilities, political system, market freedom and financing have a positive and significant individual effect on economic growth, unlike the openness factor, whose effect is positive but not significant. When the joint effect of the factors is analysed, as shown in Column 6, only two composite variables remain significant: technological capabilities and the political system. An interesting result is that, although its effect is not significant, the openness factor has a negative effect on economic growth, contrary to the theoretical considerations of openness in the literature.
Adding the set of control variables for geography, history and nature, develops three new results, as shown in Column 7. First, the coefficient of the technological capabilities factor is vaguely smaller but still significant, which implies that geography, history and nature may have an effect on the capacity to develop technological capabilities of a country. Second, the significance of the political system factor does not hold, meaning that the differences in the exogenous variables may influence the importance of the political system in economic growth; and third, the financing factor has a positive and significant effect, possibly implying that a well developed financing system may help a country offset the effects of the considered exogenous variables in economic growth.
Finally, two robustness tests are included: iteratively reweighted least squares and a stepwise regression. The iteratively reweighted least squares technique is an alternative to the least squares regression that can be used to detect and remove outliers or influential observations, giving lower weights to outliers. On the other hand, the stepwise regression adds and removes variables based only on the t-statistics of their estimated coefficients, finally eliminating those variables that do not contribute to the explanatory power of the model. As Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), the boundary for removal in this technique was set at a 20% and the level to reintroduce a variable is 15%.
Results of these robustness tests are shown in Columns 8 and 9. In both tests, the coefficient of technological capabilities remains positive and significant. Besides, the political system and
41

financing factors have a less significant but still positive effect on economic growth; and the market freedom and openness factors are removed from the model in the stepwise regression, meaning they do not contribute to the explanatory power of the model. The removal of these two factors increases the coefficient of the technological capabilities factor, and the significance and effect of the financing factor. Then, a conclusion of the first regression analysis ‚Äì using only levels of current and lagged values ‚Äì is that the only robust result is the positive and significant effect of the development of technological capabilities on economic growth.
Finally, in an attempt to prove if the implications of the previous analysis could be sustained in a dynamic framework, Fagerberg and Srholec (2008) used the so-called ‚ÄúBarro regressions‚Äù (Barro, 1991). Among the advantages of this empirical framework is the consistency with both neoclassical and Schumpeterian perspectives in the inclusion of the log of the initial level of GDP per capita; in the latter, which concerns this study, an initial low GDP per capita indicates the potential of a country to catch-up.
On the other hand, a main disadvantage of the use of Barro regressions in this study is the short period of time considered ‚Äì due to data availability ‚Äì implying only possible short-term effects. Barro (1991) designed this empirical framework for a larger time span, in an attempt to analyse long-term implications. Then, results have to be taken carefully, and a wider period of time would be more desirable in future studies, when better statistical tools and sources are available.
Besides the initial income, the inclusion of certain conditional variables can also lead to different conclusions. Then, also following Fagerberg and Srholec (2008), initial levels will be included in some specifications, since a higher level of a certain feature may induce higher growth indefinitely. Table 8 presents the results of the Barro regressions. As expected, the log of initial GDP per capita has a negative and significant effect on economic growth in all specifications, displaying the potential of a country to catch-up. Nevertheless, the other results of this analysis do not go along with what was expected from the theoretical considerations, from results in Table 7 and the results obtained by Fagerberg and Srholec (2008).
From the basic Barro regression model, displayed in Columns 1-2, one can observe that the change in technological capabilities has a significant effect on subsequent economic growth, but that this effect is negative; this means that an increase in a country‚Äôs technological capabilities factor is negative for economic growth. When the exogenous variables accounting for geography, history
42

and nature are included, the negative effect of changes in technological capabilities exacerbates, and the change in the political system factor has now a significant but negative effect: as a country adopts more Western-type political institutions, its economic growth is affected in a negative manner. Finally, the only significant and positive effect comes from the change in the openness factor, implying that positive changes in the openness of a country to international markets have a direct effect in economic growth.
When the model is expanded to include the initial levels of the five dimensions of capabilities, results from the basic model are not considerably altered ‚Äì although now the changes in the

Finally, robustness tests show that coefficients are not robust and that this methodology displays many considerations.
However, when a stepwise regression is used, but only considering developed countries ‚Äì those that belong to the OECD ‚Äì results change considerably. First, the only significant initial level is the one from the technological capabilities factor, which now has a positive effect on economic growth. This result is consistent with new growth theory, where a higher initial level of technological capabilities may induce higher growth indefinitely (Fagerberg & Srholec, 2008). Also, the changes in this factor load significant and positive, implying that changes in technological capabilities have a positive effect on economic growth, but only in developed countries. Finally, both the changes in the private financing system and the openness factors load significant, but with negative and positive effects, respectively.
This variation in the results after the exclusion of the emerging market countries can have many interpretations. From a statistical viewpoint, a possible explanation is the possibility of an endogeneity bias that can alter the coefficients2. Nonetheless, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman procedure failed to identify the possibility of an endogeneity bias. Another possible cause is the existence of measurement errors in the indicators reported by developing countries that might bias the results, especially the reliability of indicators related to science, innovation and ICT. A third statistical reason is the length of the time span considered for this analysis, making Barro regressions not appropriate for this methodology. Finally, the number of observations used in this study can explain the change in results.
New growth theory also offers a possible explanation for this outcome. Emerging countries are still imitating foreign technologies, as their rankings on the technological capabilities indicators show, so a plausible explanation might be that investing in technological capabilities reduces their income without positive returns from this investment; unlike developed countries, where investment in technological capabilities increases the average per capita income. Acemoglu,
2 For example, since R&D expenditure is included in the technological capabilities variable, it would be natural if this were an endogenous variable.
44

Aghion and Zilibotti (2006) constructed a simple endogenous model based on the idea that the optimal innovation strategy for catching up depends on the country‚Äôs distance to the world technology frontier: as an economy approaches the world technology frontier, innovation gains relative importance vis-√†-vis imitation as a source of productivity growth. In this way, developing countries, that are relatively backward economies who have not developed a proper innovation system and the needed technological and social capabilities, will follow an investment-based strategy, which is characterised by mature and big firms and large investments, long-term relationships but little selection. As these countries move closer to the world technology frontier, the adoption of established technologies becomes more difficult, so industries and firms shift to an innovation-based strategy, characterised by younger firms, short-term relationships and less investment, but a better selection of entrepreneurs. In this theoretical context, it is easier to understand why an increase in the development of technological capabilities might have a negative impact on economic growth: promoting an innovation-based strategy is not optimal when a country‚Äôs distance to technology frontier is relatively large, compared to developed countries. Then, an improvement or increase of certain features of the technological capability factor might help the transformation and diffusion of existing information into some innovation or technological improvement, like information and communication technologies, science and engineering articles or patents; unlike other features, like R&D expenditure, whose increase might not have a positive effect in the technological environment, but a negative implication for economic growth. This result opens a path for future research ‚Äì especially in terms of public policy ‚Äì based on the work of Acemoglu, Aghion and Zilibotti (2006), and Basu and Weil (1998): what will the optimal technological strategy be for emerging countries in the future years of transition, when the technology gap with developed countries closes even more?

7. CONCLUSIONS Adequate indicators of social and technological capabilities are increasingly needed to understand why do countries imitate or innovate, and why national economic performances differ. This study attempted to incorporate existing indicators of several features of the technological and social characteristics of countries and develop composite variables of capabilities through factor analysis. A noteworthy result is that, in spite of using a different statistical approach, the composite variable for technological capabilities found in this work is consistent with other existing measures in the literature. The central finding of this study is that the development of technological capabilities is highly correlated with subsequent economic growth, which goes accordingly to the findings of the new growth theory. Nevertheless, the returns of the improvement of technological capabilities on economic growth will depend inversely on the distance to the world technology frontier. Therefore, this study supports empirically the results of Aghion and Zilibotti (2006) about the relation between the optimal innovation strategy for catching up and the distance to the world technology frontier. Future research should make the most of new data to gain a better understanding from the empirical study of the complex relationship between social and technological capabilities, and economic performance. Besides, an appropriate measure of imitation and innovation would give us a better insight on what should the proper policy be to take advantage of the development of capabilities, in order to boost sustained economic growth.
